## ClassDef TestAgentInfra
**TestAgentInfra**: This class is a test case designed to verify the functionality of an agent infrastructure within a testing framework. It inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, indicating it is part of Python's unit testing module.

attributes:
· No explicit attributes are defined for this class. The methods and variables used are local to each method.

**Code Description**: Detailed analysis and description.
The `TestAgentInfra` class contains one test method, `test_agent_infra`. This method constructs a system prompt and a user prompt using template strings fetched from specified paths. These prompts are designed to simulate the generation of hypotheses in an experimental scenario involving a machine learning model (QLib).

1. **System Prompt Construction**: The system prompt is constructed by replacing placeholders in a template string with specific values. The placeholders include `targets`, `scenario`, `hypothesis_output_format`, and `hypothesis_specification`. The `T` function fetches the template string from the path `"components.proposal.prompts:hypothesis_gen.system_prompt"`, and the `.r()` method replaces the placeholders with actual data. The scenario is fetched from another path, and the output format and specification are obtained using a static method of the `PythonAgentOut` class.

2. **User Prompt Construction**: Similarly, the user prompt is constructed by replacing placeholders in a template string fetched from `"components.proposal.prompts:hypothesis_gen.user_prompt"`. The placeholders include `hypothesis_and_feedback`, `RAG`, and `targets`. These are replaced with specific values using the `.r()` method.

3. **API Call**: An instance of `APIBackend` is created, and its `build_messages_and_create_chat_completion` method is called with the constructed user and system prompts as arguments. This method likely sends these prompts to an API that generates a response based on them.

4. **Response Processing**: The response from the API call is processed using the `extract_output` static method of the `PythonAgentOut` class, which extracts the code output from the response.

5. **Output**: The extracted code is printed to the console for verification purposes.

**Note**: Usage points.
This test case is intended to be run within a testing framework that supports `unittest.TestCase`. It verifies the integration between prompt construction, API communication, and response processing in an agent infrastructure context. Developers can modify the paths used in the `T` function calls or adjust the placeholder values to suit different scenarios or testing requirements. Beginners should ensure they have a basic understanding of Python's unit testing framework and how to work with template strings and API interactions before working with this code.
### FunctionDef test_agent_infra(self)
**test_agent_infra**: This function appears to be a test case designed to verify the functionality of an agent infrastructure system. It constructs a system prompt and user prompt, sends them to an API backend for chat completion, and then extracts code from the response.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The function does not take any input arguments directly. All necessary data is hardcoded or derived within the function itself.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by constructing a system prompt using a template string fetched from a resource identified by "components.proposal.prompts:hypothesis_gen.system_prompt". This template is then rendered (r method) with specific variables:
- targets: set to the string value "targets"
- scenario: another template string fetched and rendered from "scenarios.qlib.experiment.prompts:qlib_model_background"
- hypothesis_output_format: obtained by calling a static method get_spec() on PythonAgentOut class
- hypothesis_specification: also obtained using the same method call as hypothesis_output_format

Next, it constructs a user prompt similarly using a template from "components.proposal.prompts:hypothesis_gen.user_prompt" and renders it with:
- hypothesis_and_feedback: set to "No Feedback"
- RAG: set to "No RAG"
- targets: again set to the string value "targets"

These prompts are then passed to an instance of APIBackend, which builds messages from these prompts and creates a chat completion response. The function captures this response in the variable resp.

Finally, it attempts to extract code from the chat completion response using the static method extract_output on the PythonAgentOut class, storing the result in the variable code. This extracted code is then printed out.

Note: Usage points.
This function serves as a test case for an agent infrastructure system, specifically testing the interaction between prompt construction, API communication, and output extraction. It demonstrates how prompts are built using templates and variables, how these prompts are used to generate responses via an API backend, and how the resulting response is processed to extract specific information (in this case, code). Developers can use this function as a reference for understanding the workflow of prompt-based agent systems and for testing similar functionalities in their own projects. Beginners may find it useful as an example of how different components of a software system interact to achieve a specific task.
