## ClassDef BenchmarkAnalyzer
**BenchmarkAnalyzer**: The BenchmarkAnalyzer class is designed to analyze benchmark results from factor evaluation experiments. It processes data files containing evaluation metrics, reformats indices for better readability, and computes various statistics such as success rates, correlation, and accuracy.

attributes:
· settings: An object containing configuration settings necessary for the analysis, including paths to data files.
· only_correct_format: A boolean flag indicating whether to consider only results with correct format in correlation calculations.
· index_map: A dictionary mapping factor names to their respective categories and difficulties, loaded from a JSON file specified in the settings.

Code Description: The BenchmarkAnalyzer class initializes by loading an index map that categorizes factors based on predefined criteria. It includes methods for loading data from pickle files, processing results to compute various metrics, reformatting indices for better readability, and analyzing data to derive meaningful statistics.

The `load_index_map` method reads a JSON file containing factor names along with their categories and difficulties, creating an index map used later in the analysis process. The `load_data` method loads serialized data from pickle files, ensuring that only valid file paths are processed. The `process_results` method orchestrates the loading and summarizing of results for each experiment, followed by detailed analysis.

The `reformat_index` method transforms a DataFrame's index to include categories and difficulties, enhancing readability. The `result_all_key_order` method provides an ordering mechanism for columns in the final result DataFrame based on predefined keys. The `analyze_data` method computes several metrics including success rates, correlation, and accuracy, considering only correctly formatted results if specified.

Note: Usage points highlight that BenchmarkAnalyzer is particularly useful for evaluating factor performance across different categories and difficulties, providing insights into their effectiveness and reliability.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a DataFrame with MultiIndex levels representing Factor, Category, and Difficulty. The DataFrame includes columns such as "Avg Run SR", "Avg Format SR", "Avg Correlation", "Max Correlation", "Max Accuracy", and "Avg Accuracy". Each row corresponds to a specific factor, while the last row represents average values across all factors.

Example:
```
                                                   Avg Run SR  Avg Format SR  Avg Correlation  Max Correlation  Max Accuracy  Avg Accuracy
Factor         Category Difficulty

```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, settings, only_correct_format)
**__init__**: This function initializes an instance of the `BenchmarkAnalyzer` class by setting up essential attributes based on the provided settings and configuration options.

parameters:
· settings: An object containing configuration details necessary for the benchmark analysis, including a path to the benchmark data file (`bench_data_path`).
· only_correct_format: A boolean flag indicating whether to process only factors that conform to a specific format. Defaults to `False`.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function starts by assigning the provided `settings` object to an instance attribute named `self.settings`. This settings object is crucial as it contains configuration details required for various operations within the class, particularly the path to the benchmark data file.

Next, the function calls `self.load_index_map()` to initialize the `index_map` attribute. The `load_index_map` method reads a JSON file located at the path specified in `self.settings.bench_data_path`. This file is expected to contain a dictionary where each key represents a factor name and its value includes details such as "Category" and "Difficulty". The method constructs an `index_map` by mapping each factor name to a tuple containing the factor's name, category, and difficulty level. This map serves as a structured reference for other methods in the class.

Finally, the function assigns the boolean value of `only_correct_format` to the instance attribute `self.only_correct_format`. This attribute determines whether subsequent operations should consider only factors that meet certain format criteria.

Note: Usage points.
This function is called when an instance of the `BenchmarkAnalyzer` class is created. It sets up the necessary attributes and initializes the index map, ensuring that all required data structures are ready for use by other methods in the class. The method relies on a correctly formatted JSON file at the path specified in the settings to successfully initialize the `index_map`. Proper configuration of the `settings` object is essential for the correct functioning of the `BenchmarkAnalyzer` instance.
***
### FunctionDef load_index_map(self)
**load_index_map**: This function initializes an index map by loading data from a JSON file specified in the settings. The map is structured to associate each factor name with its category and difficulty level.

parameters:
· None: This function does not accept any parameters directly. It relies on the `settings` attribute of the `BenchmarkAnalyzer` class, which should contain a path to the benchmark data file (`bench_data_path`).

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function starts by initializing an empty dictionary named `index_map`. It then opens a JSON file located at the path specified in `self.settings.bench_data_path` for reading. The contents of this file are expected to be a dictionary where each key is a factor name, and its value is another dictionary containing details about that factor such as "Category" and "Difficulty". After loading the data into `factor_dict`, the function iterates over each item in this dictionary. For each factor, it creates an entry in `index_map` with the factor name as the key and a tuple as the value. This tuple contains the factor name again, its category, and its difficulty level. Finally, the populated `index_map` is returned.

Note: Usage points.
This function is called during the initialization of the `BenchmarkAnalyzer` class. It ensures that the index map is ready to be used by other methods in the class once an instance of `BenchmarkAnalyzer` is created. The method relies on the presence of a correctly formatted JSON file at the path specified in the settings.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
{
    "FactorA": ("FactorA", "Category1", "Easy"),
    "FactorB": ("FactorB", "Category2", "Medium"),
    "FactorC": ("FactorC", "Category3", "Hard")
}
***
### FunctionDef load_data(self, file_path)
**load_data**: This function loads data from a specified file path, ensuring the file exists and has a .pkl extension before attempting to deserialize its contents using Python's pickle module.

parameters:
· file_path: A string or Path object representing the location of the file to be loaded. The file must exist and have a .pkl extension.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by converting the provided `file_path` into a Path object, which is part of Python's pathlib module. This conversion allows for easy manipulation and checking of file paths. It then verifies that the path points to an existing file and that the file has a .pkl extension, which indicates it contains pickled data. If either condition fails, a ValueError is raised with the message "Invalid file path". Assuming the file path is valid, the function opens the file in binary read mode ("rb") and uses pickle.load() to deserialize the contents of the file into a Python object. This deserialized object is then returned by the function.

Note: Usage points.
This function is primarily used within the `process_results` method of the same class (`BenchmarkAnalyzer`). In that context, `load_data` is called with paths to previously saved pickled data files, which are expected to contain results from experiments. The deserialized data is then processed further by other methods in the class.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The output of this function can vary widely depending on what was originally serialized and saved into the .pkl file. For example, if the file contained a dictionary with numerical results from an experiment, the output might look like:
```python
{
    'experiment_name': {
        'metric1': 0.85,
        'metric2': 0.79,
        ...
    }
}
```
However, since the function is generic and can load any pickled data, the actual structure of the returned object will depend on what was originally saved in the file.
***
### FunctionDef process_results(self, results)
**process_results**: This function processes a dictionary of experiment results by loading data from specified file paths, summarizing the data, analyzing it, and then extracting specific processed metrics for each experiment.

parameters:
· results: A dictionary where keys are experiment names (strings) and values are file paths (strings) to pickled files containing evaluation results.

Code Description: The function initializes an empty dictionary `final_res` to store the final processed results. It iterates over each key-value pair in the `results` dictionary, where the key is the name of an experiment and the value is the path to a file containing the results for that experiment. For each experiment, it performs the following steps:
1. Calls the `load_data` method with the file path to load the data from the pickled file.
2. Passes the loaded data to the `FactorImplementEval.summarize_res` method to summarize the evaluation results.
3. Analyzes the summarized data using the `analyze_data` method, which calculates various metrics such as success rates, correlation scores, and accuracy metrics.
4. Extracts the last row of the processed DataFrame returned by `analyze_data`, representing the final summary of the experiment's results.
5. Stores this extracted row in the `final_res` dictionary under the corresponding experiment name.

Note: This function is typically used to consolidate and summarize multiple experiments' evaluation results stored in separate files. It relies on the `load_data` method to retrieve data from file paths and the `analyze_data` method to process and analyze the data.

Output Example: Given a `results` dictionary with one entry:
```python
{
    "Experiment1": "path/to/experiment1_results.pkl"
}
```
Where `experiment1_results.pkl` contains evaluation results similar to those described in the `load_data` function's output example, the function might produce an output like:
```python
{
    'Experiment1': {
        'Avg Correlation': 0.5,
        'Avg Format SR': 0.75,
        'Avg Run SR': 0.25,
        'Max Correlation': 0.6,
        'Max Accuracy': 0.8,
        'Avg Accuracy': 0.775
    }
}
```
This output represents the final processed metrics for "Experiment1", including average correlation, format success rate, run success rate, maximum correlation, maximum accuracy, and average accuracy.
***
### FunctionDef reformat_index(self, display_df)
**reformat_index**: This function reformats a DataFrame's index to include additional hierarchical levels based on a predefined mapping. It is particularly useful for organizing evaluation results from different factors into a more structured format.

parameters:
· display_df: A pandas DataFrame with an existing single-level index that needs to be reformatted. The DataFrame should contain at least one column of data, such as 'success rate'.

Code Description: The function begins by filtering the input DataFrame `display_df` to include only those rows whose indices are present in a predefined dictionary `self.index_map`. This ensures that only relevant entries are processed.

Next, it iterates over each index in the filtered DataFrame and uses the `self.index_map` dictionary to map these indices to new tuples. Each tuple contains three elements: 'Factor', 'Category', and 'Difficulty'. These tuples are collected into a list called `new_idx`.

The function then converts this list of tuples into a MultiIndex for the DataFrame, specifying the names of each level as "Factor", "Category", and "Difficulty". This restructured index is assigned back to `display_df`, effectively transforming it from a single-level to a multi-level indexed structure.

Following the index transformation, the DataFrame's levels are swapped to reorder them correctly. The levels are first swapped between 'Factor' and 'Difficulty', then between the new position of 'Factor' (originally 'Difficulty') and 'Category'. This reordering ensures that the final DataFrame is organized by Category, Difficulty, and Factor.

Finally, the function sorts the DataFrame based on a custom order for the 'Difficulty' level. The sorting is done using a lambda function that maps difficulty levels ('Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard', 'New Discovery') to numerical values (0, 1, 2, 3), ensuring they appear in the desired sequence.

Note: This function assumes the existence of `self.index_map`, which should be a dictionary mapping original index labels to tuples representing the new hierarchical structure. Additionally, it relies on pandas functionalities for DataFrame manipulation and MultiIndex creation.

Output Example: Given an input DataFrame with a single-level index like:

```
                              success rate
High_Beta_Factor           0.2
Low_Volatility_Factor      0.8
```

And assuming `self.index_map` is defined as:
```python
{
    "High_Beta_Factor": ("量价", "Hard", "High_Beta_Factor"),
    "Low_Volatility_Factor": ("量价", "Medium", "Low_Volatility_Factor")
}
```

The function would output a DataFrame with the following structure:

```
                                                    success rate
Category Difficulty Factor                                      
量价     Hard       High_Beta_Factor           0.2
         Medium     Low_Volatility_Factor      0.8
```
***
### FunctionDef result_all_key_order(self, x)
**result_all_key_order**: This function takes a list of keys and returns a new list where each key is replaced by its corresponding predefined order value if it exists; otherwise, the original key is retained.

parameters:
· x: A list of strings representing keys that need to be ordered according to a predefined scheme.

Code Description: The function initializes an empty list named `order_v`. It then iterates over each element in the input list `x`. For each element, it checks if the element exists as a key in a predefined dictionary. If it does, the corresponding value from the dictionary (which represents the order) is appended to `order_v`. If the element does not exist in the dictionary, the original element itself is appended to `order_v`. The function finally returns the list `order_v` which contains either the ordered values or the original keys.

Note: This function is used within the `analyze_data` method of the `BenchmarkAnalyzer` class. It sorts the columns of a DataFrame based on the order defined in this function, ensuring that specific metrics like "Avg Run SR", "Avg Format SR", etc., appear in a consistent and meaningful sequence.

Output Example: If the input list is `["Avg Correlation", "Max Accuracy", "Unknown Key"]`, the output will be `[2, 4, 'Unknown Key']`. Here, "Avg Correlation" maps to 2 and "Max Accuracy" maps to 4 according to the predefined dictionary inside the function. Since "Unknown Key" is not in the dictionary, it remains unchanged in the output list.
***
### FunctionDef analyze_data(self, sum_df)
**analyze_data**: This function processes a summarized DataFrame containing evaluation results from various factor evaluators. It calculates success rates, correlation scores, and accuracy metrics while handling potential errors during the evaluation process.

parameters:
· sum_df: A pandas DataFrame that contains evaluation results indexed by different types of evaluators (e.g., "FactorSingleColumnEvaluator", "FactorRowCountEvaluator") and grouped by some criteria (likely experiments or datasets).

Code Description: The function begins by reindexing `sum_df` to ensure it includes all expected evaluator indices in a specific order. It then transposes the DataFrame and groups it by its top-level index, resetting the inner index for each group.

The function calculates the success rate of running factor evaluations by identifying rows where no errors occurred ("run factor error" column). It computes the mean success rate across these runs and reformats the resulting DataFrame's index using `reformat_index`.

Next, it addresses format-related issues by calculating the average score from "FactorRowCountEvaluator" and "FactorIndexEvaluator", treating NaN values as zero. This step also involves reformatting the index of the resulting DataFrame.

The function then focuses on correlation scores from "FactorCorrelationEvaluator". If only correctly formatted data is considered (`self.only_correct_format` flag), it filters out rows with format issues before calculating the average and maximum correlation scores, followed by index reformating.

For accuracy metrics, the function evaluates "FactorEqualValueRatioEvaluator" to determine both the maximum and average values across successful runs. Similar to previous steps, these results are also reformatted using `reformat_index`.

Finally, all calculated metrics (average correlation, format success rate, run success rate, maximum correlation, maximum accuracy, and average accuracy) are concatenated into a single DataFrame named `result_all`. This DataFrame is sorted based on predefined column order (`self.result_all_key_order`) and index levels. The function prints the full DataFrame, its mean values grouped by category, and overall mean values.

The function concludes by appending a row containing the mean of each column to the end of `result_all`, labeling it as "Average" under the MultiIndex structure. This final DataFrame is returned as the output.

Note: The function relies on several class attributes (`self.only_correct_format`, `self.index_map`) and methods (`reformat_index`, `result_all_key_order`). It assumes that `sum_df` has a specific structure with relevant columns and indices.

Output Example: Given an input DataFrame `sum_df` with the following structure:

```
                              FactorSingleColumnEvaluator  FactorRowCountEvaluator  FactorIndexEvaluator  FactorEqualValueRatioEvaluator  FactorCorrelationEvaluator  run factor error
High_Beta_Factor           0.9                            1.0                      0.8                     0.75                             0.6                         False
Low_Volatility_Factor      0.8                            NaN                      1.0                     0.8                              0.4                         True
```

The function might output a DataFrame similar to:

```
                                                    Avg Correlation  Avg Format SR  Avg Run SR  Max Correlation  Max Accuracy  Avg Accuracy
Category Difficulty Factor                                      
量价     Hard       High_Beta_Factor           0.6                1.0          0.5              0.6             0.75            0.75
         Medium     Low_Volatility_Factor      0.4                0.5          0.0              0.4             0.8             0.8
-        -          Average                  0.5                0.75         0.25             0.5             0.8             0.775
```

## ClassDef Plotter
**Plotter**: The Plotter class provides static methods to customize font sizes in plots and to generate bar plots from data. This class is designed to simplify the process of creating visually appealing and consistent plots for data analysis.

attributes:
· change_fs(font_size): A method that adjusts the font size across various elements of a plot, including titles, labels, ticks, legends, and figure titles.
· plot_data(data, file_name, title): A method that creates a bar plot from provided data, saves it to a specified file name, and includes a given title.

Code Description: The Plotter class contains two static methods. The first method, change_fs(font_size), modifies the font size for multiple components of a matplotlib plot using plt.rc() calls. This ensures that all text elements in the plot are uniformly sized according to the provided font_size parameter. This is particularly useful when preparing plots for presentations or publications where consistent typography is important.

The second method, plot_data(data, file_name, title), generates a bar plot from a pandas DataFrame. The data expected should have two columns, which are referenced as "a" and "b". Column "a" typically contains the categories or labels for each bar, while column "b" contains the values to be plotted. The method sets up a figure with a size of 10x10 inches, applies a specific color scheme to the bars, and adds text annotations above each bar to display their values rounded to two decimal places. It also rotates the x-axis labels by 45 degrees for better readability when there are many categories. The y-axis is limited from 0 to 1, which suggests that the data being plotted might represent proportions or normalized values. The plot includes a main title positioned at the top of the figure and uses plt.tight_layout() to ensure all elements fit within the figure area without overlapping. Finally, the plot is saved as an image file with the name specified by the file_name parameter.

Note: Usage points include adjusting font sizes for consistency across multiple plots or presentations and generating bar plots from processed data for visual analysis. The Plotter class simplifies these tasks by encapsulating the plotting logic within its methods, making it easier to maintain and reuse in different parts of a project. Developers can call Plotter.change_fs() before creating any plot to set a uniform font size, and use Plotter.plot_data() to generate bar plots with minimal configuration. Beginners can benefit from this class by learning how to customize matplotlib plots and handle data visualization tasks efficiently.
### FunctionDef change_fs(font_size)
**change_fs**: This function adjusts the font size of various text elements in matplotlib plots to a specified value.
parameters:
· font_size: An integer representing the new font size for plot texts.

Code Description: The change_fs function is designed to modify the default font sizes used by matplotlib for different components of a plot. It takes one parameter, 'font_size', which is an integer specifying the desired font size. The function uses plt.rc (runtime configuration) to set the font size for multiple elements including general text ("font", "size"), axis titles and labels ("axes", "titlesize" and "labelsize"), tick labels on both x and y axes ("xtick", "labelsize" and "ytick", "labelsize"), legend texts ("legend", "fontsize"), and figure titles ("figure", "titlesize"). This ensures that all text in the plots is consistently resized according to the provided font_size parameter.

Note: Usage points. The change_fs function is typically called before generating a plot to ensure that all textual elements are of an appropriate size, enhancing readability. For example, it might be used in a script where multiple plots are generated and need to have a uniform appearance or when preparing plots for presentations or publications where specific font sizes are required. In the provided context, change_fs is called with a font_size of 20 before plotting data to make sure that all text elements in the resulting plot are easily readable at this size.
***
### FunctionDef plot_data(data, file_name, title)
**plot_data**: This function generates a bar plot from given data and saves it as an image file. It is designed to visualize comparisons effectively, particularly useful for benchmark analysis.

parameters:
· data: A pandas DataFrame containing at least two columns labeled "a" (categories) and "b" (values) that will be plotted.
· file_name: The name of the output file where the plot will be saved. This should include a valid file path and extension, typically ".png".
· title: A string representing the title of the plot, which is displayed at the top.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by creating a new figure with dimensions 10x10 inches using matplotlib's `plt.figure()`. It sets the y-axis label to "Value" using `plt.ylabel()` for clarity. A list of colors is defined, which will be used to color the bars in the plot.

A bar chart is plotted using `plt.bar()`, where the categories are taken from column "a" and their corresponding values from column "b". The bars are colored according to the predefined list, and a capsize of 5 is applied for error bars (though no actual error data is provided here).

For each bar in the plot, text labels displaying the exact value are added above the bar using `plt.text()`. This enhances readability by showing precise values directly on the chart. The title of the plot is set with `plt.suptitle()` and positioned slightly below the top edge of the figure.

The x-axis tick labels (categories) are rotated 45 degrees for better visibility, especially when there are many categories or long category names. The y-axis limit is set from 0 to 1 using `plt.ylim()`, which constrains the vertical scale of the plot. This is particularly useful if all values are expected to be within this range.

To ensure that the plot elements do not overlap and fit well within the figure, `plt.tight_layout()` is called. Finally, the plot is saved to a file specified by `file_name` using `plt.savefig()`, completing the visualization process.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used in data analysis and benchmarking scenarios where visual comparison of different categories or methods is necessary. It requires a properly formatted DataFrame as input and outputs a high-quality PNG image file, making it suitable for reports and presentations. The function assumes that all values are within the 0 to 1 range; adjustments may be needed if this assumption does not hold.
