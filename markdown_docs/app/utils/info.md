## FunctionDef sys_info
**sys_info**: This function collects and logs system-related information such as the operating system name, processor architecture, system version details, and hardware information.

parameters:
· No parameters: The function does not accept any input parameters.

Code Description: The `sys_info` function is designed to gather specific pieces of information about the system on which it is executed. It uses a predefined list, `method_list`, where each element is a tuple containing a descriptive string and a method name from the `platform` module. The function iterates over this list, retrieves the corresponding system information using the `getattr` function to dynamically call methods of the `platform` module, and logs the results with the help of a logger (presumably defined elsewhere in the code). The methods used are:
- `system()`: Returns the name of the operating system.
- `machine()`: Provides the processor architecture.
- `platform()`: Offers detailed information about the system, version, and hardware.
- `version()`: Yields the version number of the system.

Note: Usage points. This function is typically called within a broader context to gather comprehensive system information. It is part of a larger set of functions (`collect_info`, `python_info`, `docker_info`, `rdagent_info`) that are used together to print detailed information about various aspects of the environment, including the system itself and installed packages.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The function does not return any value explicitly (returns None by default). However, it logs information similar to the following:
```
Name of current operating system: Linux
Processor architecture: x86_64
System, version, and hardware information: Linux-5.10.0-13-amd64-x86_64-with-glibc2.31
Version number of the system: #1 SMP Debian 5.10.106-1 (2022-03-17)
```
## FunctionDef python_info
**python_info**: Collects and logs information related to the Python environment.
parameters:
· No parameters: This function does not accept any input arguments.

Code Description: The `python_info` function is designed to gather details about the current Python runtime environment. It retrieves the version of Python that is currently executing the script by accessing `sys.version`, which provides a string containing the major, minor, and patch level of the Python interpreter along with additional information such as build number and compiler used. To ensure this information is formatted correctly for logging purposes, any newline characters (`\n`) present in the version string are replaced with spaces using the `replace` method. The resulting string, which now contains a single line of text describing the Python version, is then logged at the info level using the `logger.info()` function. This allows developers to easily track and verify the Python environment used during execution.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where system diagnostics or compatibility checks are necessary, such as in development environments, testing setups, or when deploying applications that have specific Python version requirements.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The function itself returns `None`, but it logs information to the console or log file. An example of what might be logged is:
Python version: 3.8.10 (default, Mar 15 2022, 12:22:08) [GCC 9.4.0]
## FunctionDef docker_info
**docker_info**: This function retrieves and logs detailed information about Docker containers running on the host machine using the Docker SDK for Python.

parameters:
· No parameters: The function does not accept any input arguments.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `docker_info` function begins by establishing a connection to the Docker daemon through the `docker.from_env()` method, which uses environment variables to configure the client. It then retrieves a list of all containers on the system with `client.containers.list(all=True)`, where the `all=True` parameter ensures that both running and stopped containers are included.

If there are any containers present in the list, they are sorted by their creation time using the `sort()` method with a lambda function as the key. This lambda function accesses the "Created" attribute of each container's attributes dictionary to determine the order. The last container in this sorted list (the most recently created) is selected for detailed logging.

The function logs several pieces of information about the last container:
- Container ID: A unique identifier for the container.
- Container Name: The name assigned to the container, which can be user-defined or automatically generated.
- Container Status: Indicates whether the container is currently running, stopped, paused, etc.
- Image ID used by the container: The unique identifier of the Docker image from which the container was instantiated.
- Image tag used by the container: Tags associated with the Docker image, providing a human-readable reference to the image version or variant.
- Container port mapping: Information about any ports that have been exposed and mapped between the host machine and the container.
- Container Label: Metadata labels attached to the container, which can be used for categorization or additional information.
- Startup Commands: The command(s) specified in the Dockerfile or passed at runtime that are executed when the container starts.

If no containers are found on the system, a log message indicating "No run containers." is emitted instead.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically called as part of a larger routine to gather system information, such as within the `collect_info` function. It provides valuable insights into the Docker environment and can be useful for debugging or monitoring purposes. Developers should ensure that the Docker SDK for Python (`docker`) is installed in their environment to use this function successfully. Additionally, appropriate permissions are required to interact with the Docker daemon.
## FunctionDef rdagent_info
**rdagent_info**: This function collects information related to the RD-Agent, specifically its version and the versions of packages listed in the requirements.txt file from the main branch of the RD-Agent GitHub repository.

parameters:
· No parameters: The function does not accept any input arguments.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function starts by importing the current version of the "rdagent" package using `importlib.metadata.version` and logs this information. It then constructs a URL to access the contents of the requirements.txt file in the main branch of the RD-Agent GitHub repository. A GET request is made to this URL, and if successful (HTTP status code 200), it retrieves the JSON response which contains metadata about the file, including its download URL.

Another GET request is made using the download URL to fetch the actual contents of the requirements.txt file. If this request is also successful, the content is split into individual lines. Lines that are empty or start with a hash (#) (indicating comments in the requirements.txt file) are ignored. The remaining lines represent package names and possibly their versions.

The function then processes these package names to remove any version specifiers and comments, resulting in a clean list of package names. For each package name, it retrieves the installed version using `importlib.metadata.version`. If the package is specified with extras (e.g., "typer[all]"), it adjusts the package name accordingly before retrieving its version.

The versions of all packages are formatted as strings in the form "package==version" and logged. The function does not return any value explicitly, hence returning `None` by default.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used to gather detailed information about the RD-Agent's environment, including its own version and the versions of dependencies it relies on. This can be particularly useful for debugging or ensuring compatibility with specific package versions.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
While the function does not return any value explicitly, it logs information to the console. Here is an example of what might be logged:

RD-Agent version: 1.2.3
Package version: ['package1==0.9.8', 'package2==1.4.5', 'typer==0.6.1']
## FunctionDef collect_info
**collect_info**: This function aggregates and logs detailed information about the system environment, including system-related details, Python runtime specifics, Docker container status, and RD-Agent version along with its dependencies.

parameters:
· No parameters: The function does not accept any input arguments.

Code Description: The `collect_info` function serves as a comprehensive utility to gather and log various pieces of information about the current execution environment. It orchestrates this by sequentially invoking four other functions: `sys_info`, `python_info`, `docker_info`, and `rdagent_info`. Each of these functions is responsible for collecting specific types of data:
- `sys_info` gathers system-related information such as the operating system, processor architecture, and version details.
- `python_info` retrieves and logs details about the Python environment, including the version of the interpreter.
- `docker_info` provides detailed logging about Docker containers running on the host machine, focusing on the most recently created container.
- `rdagent_info` collects information about the RD-Agent, specifically its version and the versions of packages listed in the requirements.txt file from the main branch of the RD-Agent GitHub repository.

The function itself does not perform any data collection or logging directly. Instead, it acts as a coordinator that ensures all relevant pieces of information are gathered by calling the appropriate functions. After invoking these functions, `collect_info` returns `None`.

Note: This function is typically used in scenarios where a detailed overview of the system and software environment is required, such as during debugging, compatibility checks, or when setting up new environments.

Output Example: While the function does not return any value explicitly, it logs information to the console or log file. Here is an example of what might be logged:

```
