## FunctionDef check_docker
**check_docker**: This function verifies if Docker is installed correctly on the system by attempting to pull a standard "hello-world" image, run it as a container, print its logs, and then clean up by removing the container.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `check_docker` function begins by initializing a Docker client using the environment settings with `docker.from_env()`. It then proceeds to pull the "hello-world" image from Docker Hub, which is a standard test image used for verifying Docker installations. After pulling the image, it runs this image as a container in detached mode (`detach=True`). The logs of the running container are captured using `container.logs()` and decoded from bytes to a UTF-8 string before being printed. This step is crucial as the "hello-world" container outputs a message confirming that Docker has been installed correctly.

Following the successful execution, the function removes the container with `container.remove()` to clean up resources. If all operations are completed without errors, it logs an informational message indicating that the Docker status is normal using `logger.info`.

However, if any part of this process fails (e.g., Docker is not installed or configured correctly), a `docker.errors.DockerException` will be raised. The function catches this exception and logs an error message detailing the issue with `logger.error`. Additionally, it provides a warning to check the Docker configuration or reinstall Docker, along with a reference link to the official Docker installation documentation for Ubuntu systems.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used as part of a broader health-check routine to ensure that Docker is properly set up and operational before proceeding with other tasks that depend on Docker. It serves as a simple yet effective way to verify Docker's functionality by leveraging a well-known test image. Developers can integrate this function into their applications or scripts to automate the verification process, enhancing reliability and reducing manual checks. Beginners can use this function as an example of how to interact with Docker through its Python API, providing insights into container management and error handling in Docker operations.
## FunctionDef is_port_in_use(port)
**is_port_in_use**: This function checks if a specified port on localhost (127.0.0.1) is currently in use.
parameters:
· port: An integer representing the port number to check.

Code Description: The function utilizes Python's socket library to create a TCP socket and attempts to connect to the specified port on localhost. It uses the `connect_ex` method, which returns an error indicator instead of raising an exception if the connection fails. If the return value is 0, it indicates that the port is in use because the connection attempt was successful. Otherwise, the port is not in use.

Note: This function is typically used to verify the availability of a port before binding a server socket to it or for diagnostic purposes to identify which ports are occupied on a system. It is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple services might try to bind to the same default port and lead to conflicts.

Output Example: If you call `is_port_in_use(80)`, and port 80 is being used by another service, the function will return `True`. Conversely, if port 80 is not in use, it will return `False`.
## FunctionDef check_and_list_free_ports(start_port, max_ports)
**check_and_list_free_ports**: This function checks if a specified starting port (default 19899) is occupied on localhost, and if it is, lists up to a specified number of free ports (default 10) from that range.

parameters:
· start_port: An integer representing the starting port number to check. The default value is 19899.
· max_ports: An integer indicating the maximum number of free ports to find and list if the starting port is occupied. The default value is 10.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the specified start_port is in use using the `is_port_in_use` function. If the port is occupied, it initializes an empty list called `free_ports`. It then iterates over a range of ports from `start_port` to `start_port + max_ports`, checking each one for availability with `is_port_in_use`. Any free ports found are appended to the `free_ports` list. After checking all specified ports, it logs a warning message indicating that the starting port is occupied and suggests replacing it with an available port from the list of free ports. If the start_port is not occupied, it logs an informational message stating that the port is available for use.

Note: This function is typically used to ensure that a specific port (often a default one) is available before attempting to bind a service to it. It helps in avoiding conflicts with other services that might be using the same port. The function can also assist developers and beginners by providing alternative free ports if the desired starting port is unavailable, thus facilitating easier setup and troubleshooting of networked applications.
## FunctionDef health_check
**health_check**: This function performs a health check to verify if Docker is installed correctly on the system and checks whether specific ports used in the sample README are available.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `health_check` function serves as an essential routine for ensuring that the necessary environment conditions are met before proceeding with other operations. It begins by invoking the `check_docker` function, which verifies the installation and functionality of Docker on the system. This verification process includes pulling a standard "hello-world" image from Docker Hub, running it in a container, printing its logs to confirm successful execution, and then cleaning up by removing the container.

Following the Docker check, the function calls `check_and_list_free_ports`. This function checks if a specified starting port (default 19899) is occupied on localhost. If the port is occupied, it identifies up to a specified number of free ports (default 10) from that range and logs them as potential alternatives. If the starting port is not occupied, it confirms its availability for use.

This dual-check mechanism ensures that both Docker's readiness and the availability of necessary network ports are confirmed before any dependent operations are executed, thereby enhancing the reliability and robustness of the application setup process.

Note: This function is typically used as part of an initialization or startup routine to ensure that all prerequisites are met. It helps developers and beginners by providing clear feedback on Docker's status and available network ports, facilitating easier troubleshooting and configuration of their applications. By integrating this health check into their workflows, users can avoid common issues related to Docker misconfigurations and port conflicts, leading to a smoother development experience.
