## ClassDef ModelRDLoop
**ModelRDLoop**: This class extends RDLoop and is specifically designed to handle the R&D evolving loop for models within a medical scenario. It includes an attribute to skip certain types of errors during the execution of its loop.

attributes:
· skip_loop_error: A tuple containing error classes that should be skipped during the loop's execution. In this case, it skips ModelEmptyError.

Code Description: The ModelRDLoop class inherits from RDLoop and overrides or extends its functionality by specifying a particular set of exceptions to ignore during its operation. This is particularly useful in scenarios where certain errors are expected and can be safely ignored without disrupting the overall process flow. The skip_loop_error attribute is initialized with a tuple containing ModelEmptyError, indicating that this specific error should not halt the loop's execution.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of ModelRDLoop either with default settings or by loading from a specified path. This class is typically instantiated and run within the main function defined in model.py, which can be executed via command line to continue running sessions for model development in medical contexts. The step_n parameter allows specifying how many steps should be taken during each execution of the loop.
## FunctionDef main(path, step_n)
**main**: This function serves as the entry point for an automated Research and Development (R&D) evolving loop specifically designed for models within a medical context. It initializes or loads a ModelRDLoop instance based on provided parameters and runs it, optionally specifying the number of steps to execute.

parameters:
· path: A string representing the file path from which to load a previously saved session of the ModelRDLoop. If not provided (i.e., None), a new ModelRDLoop is initialized with default settings defined by MED_PROP_SETTING.
· step_n: An integer indicating the number of steps the model loop should execute during this run. This parameter is optional and defaults to None, which means the loop will run according to its internal logic without a specific step count.

Code Description: The function first checks if the path parameter is provided. If not, it creates a new instance of ModelRDLoop using default settings specified by MED_PROP_SETTING. If a path is given, it loads an existing ModelRDLoop session from that location. After initializing or loading the loop, the function calls its run method, passing step_n as an argument to control how many steps the loop should execute.

Note: This function is typically executed via command line to continue running sessions for model development in medical contexts. Users can specify both the path to a saved session and the number of steps to take during each execution of the loop. The ModelRDLoop class, which this function interacts with, is designed to handle specific exceptions (like ModelEmptyError) that might occur during its operation, ensuring the process continues smoothly without interruption from these expected errors.
