· scen: A string specifying the scenario class path "rdagent.scenarios.qlib.experiment.model_experiment.QlibModelScenario" which defines the experimental setup for the model.
· hypothesis_gen: A string indicating the hypothesis generation class path "rdagent.scenarios.qlib.proposal.model_proposal.QlibModelHypothesisGen". This class is responsible for generating hypotheses based on the defined scenarios.
· hypothesis2experiment: A string representing the class path "rdagent.scenarios.qlib.proposal.model_proposal.QlibModelHypothesis2Experiment" used to convert generated hypotheses into executable experiments.
· coder: A string denoting the coder class path "rdagent.scenarios.qlib.developer.model_coder.QlibModelCoSTEER". This component is responsible for coding or translating the experimental setups into a form that can be executed by the model.
· runner: A string pointing to the runner class path "rdagent.scenarios.qlib.developer.model_runner.QlibModelRunner", which executes the coded experiments.
· summarizer: A string specifying the summarizer class path "rdagent.scenarios.qlib.developer.feedback.QlibModelHypothesisExperiment2Feedback". This component is used to summarize the results of the executed experiments and provide feedback for further iterations.
· evolving_n: An integer value set to 10, representing the number of evolutionary steps or iterations in the model development process.

Code Description: The ModelBasePropSetting class inherits from BasePropSetting and overrides several base settings to tailor them specifically for Qlib models. It initializes a configuration dictionary with an environment prefix that helps in distinguishing these configurations from others. The class defines various string attributes, each pointing to specific classes responsible for different stages of the model development lifecycle: scenario setup, hypothesis generation, conversion of hypotheses into experiments, coding and running these experiments, and summarizing their results. These components work together in a loop to iteratively improve the models based on feedback from experiment outcomes.

Note: Usage points include setting up new Qlib model experiments by configuring the appropriate class paths for each stage of the development process. Developers can customize this configuration by modifying the string attributes to point to different classes or implementations as needed. The evolving_n attribute allows control over the number of iterations in the evolutionary process, which is crucial for fine-tuning and optimizing the models.
## ClassDef FactorBasePropSetting
**FactorBasePropSetting**: This class serves as a configuration settings base for defining properties related to Qlib factor experiments within an RD (Research and Development) loop. It inherits from `BasePropSetting` and is designed to be overridden or extended by other classes that require specific configurations.

attributes:
· model_config: A configuration dictionary with environment prefix "QLIB_FACTOR_" and no protected namespaces, used for setting up the model's configuration.
· scen: Specifies the scenario class for Qlib Factor experiments. It points to a class responsible for defining the experimental setup.
· hypothesis_gen: Indicates the hypothesis generation class that is utilized in creating hypotheses for factor experiments.
· hypothesis2experiment: Refers to the class responsible for converting generated hypotheses into executable experiments.
· coder: Denotes the coder class used for coding or implementing the factors based on the experiment outcomes.
· runner: Specifies the runner class that executes the coded factors as part of the experiment.
· summarizer: Points to the summarizer class, which processes and provides feedback from the executed experiments.
· evolving_n: An integer representing the number of evolutions or iterations in the factor development process.

Code Description: The `FactorBasePropSetting` class is a foundational configuration class designed for Qlib factor experiments. It sets up essential components such as scenario management, hypothesis generation, coding, running, and summarizing processes. Each attribute within this class represents a critical component of the experimental workflow, ensuring that each step from hypothesis creation to feedback analysis is well-defined and configurable.

The `model_config` attribute allows for environment-specific configurations with a designated prefix, making it easier to manage settings through environment variables. The other attributes (`scen`, `hypothesis_gen`, `hypothesis2experiment`, `coder`, `runner`, `summarizer`) are strings that point to specific classes responsible for different stages of the factor development process. This design promotes modularity and flexibility, allowing developers to customize each stage independently.

The `evolving_n` attribute is an integer that determines the number of iterations or evolutions in the experimental loop, which can be crucial for refining factors over multiple cycles.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where specific configurations are needed for Qlib factor experiments. Developers can extend this class to create more specialized settings by overriding attributes as demonstrated in `FactorFromReportPropSetting`, where the scenario and additional report-specific parameters are customized.
## ClassDef FactorFromReportPropSetting
**FactorFromReportPropSetting**: This class extends `FactorBasePropSetting` to provide specific configuration settings for factor experiments derived from research reports within a Qlib RD loop. It customizes the scenario attribute and introduces additional attributes tailored for handling report-based factor extraction.

attributes:
· scen: Specifies the scenario class for Qlib Factor experiments focused on extracting factors from research reports. It points to "rdagent.scenarios.qlib.experiment.factor_from_report_experiment.QlibFactorFromReportScenario", which is responsible for defining the experimental setup for this specific type of experiment.
· report_result_json_file_path: Path to a JSON file that lists research reports intended for factor extraction. This attribute directs the system to the location of the report list, facilitating automated processing and analysis of these documents.
· max_factors_per_exp: Maximum number of factors that can be implemented in a single experiment. This setting helps manage computational resources by limiting the scope of each experimental run.
· is_report_limit_enabled: A boolean flag indicating whether the processing of research reports should be limited to a certain count or if all available reports should be processed. When set to True, it enables report processing limits; when False, all reports are processed.

Code Description: The `FactorFromReportPropSetting` class builds upon the foundational configuration provided by `FactorBasePropSetting`, specifically tailoring its attributes for experiments that involve extracting factors from research reports. By overriding the `scen` attribute, it directs the experimental setup to use a scenario class designed for this purpose, ensuring that the experiment aligns with the goals of factor extraction from reports.

The introduction of new attributes such as `report_result_json_file_path`, `max_factors_per_exp`, and `is_report_limit_enabled` further customizes the configuration to handle report-based experiments efficiently. The `report_result_json_file_path` attribute specifies where the system can find the list of research reports, enabling automated processing. The `max_factors_per_exp` attribute sets a limit on the number of factors that can be implemented in one experiment, which is useful for managing computational resources and avoiding excessive processing times. Lastly, the `is_report_limit_enabled` flag provides control over whether to process all available reports or limit the number processed, offering flexibility depending on the experimental requirements.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where factor experiments need to be derived from research reports. Developers can utilize this class as a configuration template for setting up such experiments, ensuring that all necessary parameters are correctly defined and aligned with the specific goals of report-based factor extraction. This setup promotes modularity and flexibility, allowing developers to customize each stage independently while leveraging the foundational components provided by `FactorBasePropSetting`.
