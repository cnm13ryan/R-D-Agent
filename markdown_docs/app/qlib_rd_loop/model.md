## ClassDef ModelRDLoop
**ModelRDLoop**: This class extends RDLoop and is specifically designed to handle the research and development loop for financial technology models, particularly focusing on model evolution through an iterative process.

attributes:
· skip_loop_error: A tuple containing exceptions that the loop should skip over during its execution. In this case, it includes ModelEmptyError, indicating that if a ModelEmptyError occurs, the loop will continue without interruption.

Code Description: The ModelRDLoop class inherits from RDLoop and overrides or specifies certain behaviors for handling errors during the model development process. By setting `skip_loop_error` to include ModelEmptyError, the class ensures that any instance of this specific error does not halt the execution of the loop. This is particularly useful in scenarios where an empty model might be encountered but should not prevent further iterations of the research and development cycle.

The main function demonstrates how instances of ModelRDLoop are created and used. If a path to a previous session is provided, it loads that session; otherwise, it initializes a new session with predefined settings (MODEL_PROP_SETTING). The `run` method of the ModelRDLoop instance is then called, which presumably contains the logic for iterating through the model development steps.

Note: Usage points include initializing a new loop or loading an existing one based on a provided path. This flexibility allows developers to either start fresh or continue from where they left off in their model development process. The optional `step_n` parameter in the main function can be used to specify how many iterations of the loop should run, providing control over the extent of each session's execution.
## FunctionDef main(path, step_n)
**main**: Auto R&D Evolving loop for fintech models. This function initializes or loads a research and development loop for financial technology models, specifically using the ModelRDLoop class. It allows for continuing an existing session or starting a new one with predefined settings.

parameters:
· path: A string representing the file path to a previous session's data. If provided, the function will load this session; if not, it initializes a new session with default settings.
· step_n: An optional integer parameter that specifies how many iterations of the loop should run. If not specified, the loop may run indefinitely or until another stopping condition is met.

Code Description: The main function serves as an entry point for initiating or resuming the model development process within the fintech domain. It first checks if a path to a previous session's data is provided. If so, it loads this session using the ModelRDLoop.load method; otherwise, it creates a new instance of ModelRDLoop with predefined settings stored in MODEL_PROP_SETTING. After setting up the appropriate ModelRDLoop instance, the function calls its run method, passing the step_n parameter to control the number of iterations. This setup allows for both fresh starts and continuations of existing model development sessions.

Note: Usage points include initializing a new loop or loading an existing one based on a provided path. The optional `step_n` parameter in the main function can be used to specify how many iterations of the loop should run, providing control over the extent of each session's execution. This flexibility is crucial for managing different stages and phases of model development efficiently.
