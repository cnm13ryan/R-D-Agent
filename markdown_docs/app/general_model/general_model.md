## FunctionDef extract_models_and_implement(report_file_path)
**extract_models_and_implement**: This function automates the process of extracting models from a PDF report file and implementing the necessary operations based on the extracted information.

parameters:
Â· report_file_path: A string representing the path to the PDF report file from which models are to be extracted. The file must be in PDF format.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function `extract_models_and_implement` is designed to facilitate the automatic extraction and implementation of models described in a scientific or technical PDF report. It operates through several key steps, each encapsulated within a logging tag for clarity and debugging purposes:

1. **Initialization**: The process begins with the creation of an instance of `GeneralModelScenario`. This scenario object likely contains configurations and settings necessary for the subsequent model extraction and implementation processes. The scenario is then logged under the tag "scenario" to provide visibility into its state.

2. **Report Processing**:
   - The function extracts a screenshot of the first page from the specified PDF report file using `extract_first_page_screenshot_from_pdf`. This image, tagged as "pdf_image", is logged for reference.
   - Following this, an instance of `ModelExperimentLoaderFromPDFfiles` is used to load and parse the experiment details contained within the PDF. The loaded experiment object, denoted by `exp`, encapsulates all relevant information extracted from the report and is logged under the tag "load_experiment".

3. **Model Development**: 
   - With the experiment data now available, an instance of `QlibModelCoSTEER` is utilized to develop or refine the models based on the scenario settings. This step likely involves translating the theoretical descriptions in the PDF into practical model implementations.
   - The developed experiment object, which now includes the implemented models, is logged under the tag "developed_experiment" for further reference and verification.

Note: Usage points.
This function is particularly useful for researchers or developers who need to quickly implement models described in academic papers or reports without manually translating the descriptions into code. By providing a direct path from PDF content to functional models, it streamlines the research-to-implementation process. Users should ensure that the input PDF file is well-formatted and contains clear descriptions of the models to be extracted for optimal results.
