## FunctionDef md5_hash(input_string)
**md5_hash**: This function computes the MD5 hash of a given input string and returns it as a hexadecimal string.
parameters:
· input_string: A string for which the MD5 hash is to be computed.

Code Description: The `md5_hash` function starts by creating an MD5 hash object using Python's `hashlib` library with security usage explicitly set to False. This indicates that the hash is not intended for cryptographic purposes but rather for checksums or non-security-related tasks. The input string is then encoded into bytes using UTF-8 encoding, which is necessary because the hashing function operates on byte data. These bytes are fed into the MD5 hash object via the `update` method. Finally, the hexadecimal representation of the computed hash is obtained through the `hexdigest` method and returned as a string.

Note: The function is used in several methods within the `SQliteLazyCache` class to generate an MD5 key from user-provided strings. This MD5 key serves as a unique identifier for storing and retrieving chat and embedding data in SQLite databases, ensuring efficient lookups without exposing sensitive information directly in the database.

Output Example: For an input string "Hello, world!", the function would return a hash like "65a8e27d8879283831b664bd8b7f0ad4".
## ClassDef ConvManager
**ConvManager**: This class serves as a conversation manager for Large Language Models (LLMs). It facilitates the convenience of exporting conversations, which is particularly useful for debugging purposes.

attributes:
· path: Specifies the directory where conversation files will be stored. It can be provided as either a `Path` object or a string. By default, it points to a subdirectory named "llm_conv" within the DEFAULT_QLIB_DOT_PATH.
· recent_n: Determines the maximum number of recent conversation files to keep. Older files are automatically rotated out.

Code Description: The ConvManager class is designed to manage and store conversations in JSON format. Upon initialization, it ensures that the specified directory exists by creating any necessary parent directories. The _rotate_files method handles file rotation based on the recent_n attribute. It identifies existing conversation files, sorts them numerically, and renames them to maintain only the most recent conversations up to the limit defined by recent_n. If a new file is created or an older one is renamed, it ensures that no duplicate filenames exist by deleting any conflicting files before renaming.

The append method is used to add a new conversation to the directory. Before writing the new conversation, it calls _rotate_files to manage existing files according to the rotation rules. The conversation data, provided as a tuple containing a list and a string, is then written to a file named "0.json" in the specified path.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of ConvManager with a desired directory and maximum number of recent conversations. Developers can use the append method to store new conversations, which will be automatically managed according to the rotation rules defined by the recent_n attribute. This setup is particularly useful for debugging purposes, as it allows easy access to recent interactions between the LLM and users or other systems.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, recent_n)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the ConvManager class, setting up the path where conversation data will be stored and configuring how many recent conversations to keep track of.

parameters:
· path: Specifies the directory path where conversation data will be stored. It can be provided as either a Path object or a string. If not specified, it defaults to DEFAULT_QLIB_DOT_PATH / "llm_conv".
· recent_n: An integer that determines how many of the most recent conversations should be kept track of. The default value is 10.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __init__ method serves as the constructor for the ConvManager class, responsible for initializing its essential attributes upon creation of a new instance. It accepts two parameters: 'path' and 'recent_n'. 

The 'path' parameter allows users to specify where conversation data will be stored on their system. This path can be provided either as a Path object or a string. If no path is specified, the method defaults to using DEFAULT_QLIB_DOT_PATH / "llm_conv" as the storage location for conversation data. The method converts this input into a Path object and ensures that the directory exists by calling mkdir with parents=True and exist_ok=True. This means it will create any necessary parent directories if they do not already exist, and it will not raise an error if the directory already exists.

The 'recent_n' parameter is used to set how many of the most recent conversations should be tracked or stored for easy access. This value is directly assigned to the instance variable self.recent_n. By default, this is set to 10, meaning that by default, the ConvManager will keep track of the last ten conversations.

Note: Usage points.
When creating an instance of ConvManager, developers can specify a custom path for storing conversation data and adjust the number of recent conversations they wish to keep track of. This flexibility allows for tailored management of conversation history according to specific project needs or user preferences. If no arguments are provided, the ConvManager will use default settings, making it easy to get started without additional configuration.

### FunctionDef _rotate_files(self)
**_rotate_files**: This function manages file rotation within a specified directory by renaming existing JSON files to increment their numeric prefixes, ensuring only a certain number of recent files are retained.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates on instance attributes such as `self.path` and `self.recent_n`.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `_rotate_files` function is designed to handle file rotation in a directory, specifically targeting JSON files. It begins by initializing an empty list named `pairs`, which will store tuples of integers (representing the numeric prefix) and file objects.

The function iterates over all `.json` files located at `self.path`. For each file, it uses a regular expression to match filenames that start with a number followed by `.json`. If a match is found, the numeric part of the filename is extracted, converted to an integer, and paired with the file object in the `pairs` list.

After collecting all relevant files, the function sorts these pairs based on their numeric prefixes in ascending order. This sorting ensures that the oldest files (those with the smallest numbers) are processed first.

The subsequent loop processes only the most recent `self.recent_n` files by slicing the sorted list and reversing it to start from the newest file. For each of these files, the function checks if a file with an incremented numeric prefix already exists in the directory. If such a file exists, it is deleted using the `unlink()` method.

Finally, the current file is renamed to have its numeric prefix incremented by one, effectively rotating the files and making space for new data to be stored as the newest file (with the smallest number).

Note: Usage points.
This function is primarily called by the `append` method of the same class. When a new conversation (`conv`) needs to be appended, `_rotate_files` is invoked first to manage existing files according to the rotation policy defined by `self.recent_n`. This ensures that only the most recent conversations are retained in the directory, with older ones being rotated out or deleted as necessary.
***
### FunctionDef append(self, conv)
**append**: This function appends a new conversation to the managed directory by first rotating existing files according to a predefined policy and then storing the new conversation as the newest file.

parameters:
· conv: A tuple consisting of a list and a string, representing the conversation data to be appended.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `append` function is designed to handle the addition of new conversation data while maintaining a controlled number of recent conversations in a directory. The process begins with invoking the `_rotate_files` method, which ensures that only the most recent files are retained by renaming existing JSON files to increment their numeric prefixes or deleting older ones as necessary.

After file rotation is managed, the function proceeds to write the new conversation data (`conv`) into a file named `0.json`. This filename signifies that it is the newest file in the sequence. The conversation data, which includes both a list and a string, is serialized into JSON format using the `json.dump` method and written to the file.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used when a new conversation needs to be stored while adhering to a policy that limits the number of recent conversations retained in the directory. By calling `_rotate_files`, it ensures that space is made for the new data by managing existing files, thus maintaining an organized and limited set of recent conversations. This approach is particularly useful in applications where storage management and quick access to recent interactions are important, such as chatbots or messaging systems.
***
## ClassDef SQliteLazyCache
**SQliteLazyCache**: A class designed to provide a lazy caching mechanism using SQLite as the backend storage. It supports storing chat, embedding, and message data with functionalities to retrieve and set these items based on unique keys.

attributes:
· cache_location: A string representing the file path where the SQLite database will be stored or is already located.

Code Description: The SQliteLazyCache class inherits from SingletonBaseClass, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application. Upon initialization, it checks if a database file exists at the specified location. If not, it creates three tables within the SQLite database: chat_cache for storing chat data, embedding_cache for embeddings, and message_cache for messages associated with conversation IDs.

The class provides methods to interact with these caches:
- `chat_get`: Retrieves chat data based on an MD5 hash of a provided key.
- `embedding_get`: Fetches embedding data from the cache using an MD5 hash of the key. The returned value is deserialized from JSON format.
- `chat_set`: Inserts or updates chat data in the cache, associating it with an MD5 hash of the key.
- `embedding_set`: Accepts a dictionary where keys are items to be hashed and values are embeddings. It inserts or updates these entries in the embedding_cache table after serializing the embeddings into JSON format.
- `message_get`: Retrieves messages for a specific conversation ID from the message_cache table, deserializing them from JSON format.
- `message_set`: Inserts or updates messages for a given conversation ID in the message_cache table by serializing the list of messages into JSON format.

Note: The class uses MD5 hashing to generate keys for storing and retrieving data. It is important to ensure that the cache_location points to a valid file path where the SQLite database can be created or accessed. Additionally, the class does not support multiprocessing due to limitations in sqlite3.

Output Example: When calling `chat_get` with an existing key, it might return a string like "Hello, how are you?" if this chat entry is stored under that key's MD5 hash in the cache. If the key does not exist, it will return None. Similarly, `embedding_get` could return a list or dictionary representing the embedding data associated with the key, such as `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]`. The `message_get` method might return a list of messages like ["Hello!", "I'm fine, thank you.", "How about you?"] for a given conversation ID if these messages are stored in the cache.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, cache_location)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of SQliteLazyCache by setting up a connection to an SQLite database at the specified location. If the database file does not exist, it creates the necessary tables for caching chat, embedding, and message data.

parameters:
· cache_location: A string representing the path where the SQLite database file is located or should be created.

Code Description: The function begins by calling the superclass's initializer using `super().__init__()`. It then assigns the provided `cache_location` to an instance variable. The existence of the database file at this location is checked using Python's `Path.exists()` method. A connection to the SQLite database is established with a timeout set to 20 seconds, which helps in managing situations where the database might be locked by another process.

If the database file does not exist, the function proceeds to create three tables within the database:
1. `chat_cache`: Stores chat data with an `md5_key` as the primary key and `chat` text.
2. `embedding_cache`: Stores embedding data with an `md5_key` as the primary key and `embedding` text.
3. `message_cache`: Stores message data with a `conversation_id` as the primary key and `message` text.

After creating these tables, any changes are committed to the database using `self.conn.commit()`.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the provided `cache_location` is a valid path where the application has write permissions. Developers should also be aware of SQLite's limitations regarding multiprocessing, as mentioned in the TODO comment within the code. This means that if the application requires concurrent access to the database from multiple processes, additional measures such as using locks or switching to a different database system might be necessary.
***
### FunctionDef chat_get(self, key)
**chat_get**: This function retrieves a chat entry from an SQLite database using an MD5 hash of the provided key as the unique identifier.

parameters:
· key: A string that serves as the input for generating an MD5 hash, which is used to look up the corresponding chat data in the database.

Code Description: The `chat_get` method begins by computing the MD5 hash of the input key using the `md5_hash` function. This hash acts as a unique identifier for the chat entry stored in the SQLite database. The method then constructs and executes an SQL query to select the chat data associated with this MD5 key from the `chat_cache` table. If no matching record is found, the method returns `None`. Otherwise, it retrieves and returns the chat data from the first column of the result set.

Note: This function is typically used within caching mechanisms to efficiently retrieve previously stored chat entries based on a unique key. The use of MD5 hashing ensures that sensitive information is not directly exposed in the database while still allowing for quick lookups.

Output Example: For an input string "unique_chat_key", if there is a corresponding entry in the `chat_cache` table, the function might return a string like "Hello! How can I assist you today?". If no such entry exists, it will return `None`.
***
### FunctionDef embedding_get(self, key)
**embedding_get**: This function retrieves an embedding from a SQLite database using a given key. It first computes the MD5 hash of the input key to use as a unique identifier for lookup in the database.

parameters:
· key: A string that serves as the key for which the corresponding embedding is to be retrieved.

Code Description: The `embedding_get` function begins by generating an MD5 hash of the provided key using the `md5_hash` function. This hash acts as a unique identifier (md5_key) in the SQLite database. The function then executes a SQL query on the database connection (`self.c`) to select the embedding associated with this md5_key from the table named `embedding_cache`. If no result is found, indicating that there is no stored embedding for the given key, the function returns None. Otherwise, it retrieves the embedding data as a JSON string from the first column of the query result and parses it into its original Python object (which could be a list, dictionary, or string) using `json.loads`, before returning this parsed object.

Note: This function is typically used within caching mechanisms to avoid redundant computations or API calls by retrieving precomputed embeddings stored in a database. It is particularly useful in applications involving natural language processing where embeddings are frequently reused.

Output Example: For an input key "example text", if the corresponding embedding is stored as a JSON string '["0.1", "0.2", "0.3"]' in the database, the function would return the list [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]. If no such entry exists for the key, it would return None.
***
### FunctionDef chat_set(self, key, value)
**chat_set**: This function stores a chat entry into an SQLite database using a key-value pair approach. The key is hashed using MD5 to create a unique identifier for efficient storage and retrieval.

parameters:
· key: A string representing the original key used to identify the chat data.
· value: A string containing the chat data that needs to be stored in the database.

Code Description: The function begins by generating an MD5 hash of the provided `key` using the `md5_hash` function. This hash serves as a unique identifier for storing and retrieving the chat data in the SQLite database. The hashed key (`md5_key`) along with the `value` (chat data) is then inserted into the `chat_cache` table of the SQLite database. If an entry with the same `md5_key` already exists, it will be replaced by the new value due to the use of "INSERT OR REPLACE". After executing the SQL command, the changes are committed to the database using `self.conn.commit()`.

Note: This function is typically used in scenarios where chat data needs to be cached for quick access. For example, in an application that interacts with a language model API, storing previous chat sessions can help reduce the number of API calls and improve response times by retrieving cached responses when the same input is encountered again. The use of MD5 hashing ensures that the keys are stored securely without exposing sensitive information directly in the database.
***
### FunctionDef embedding_set(self, content_to_embedding_dict)
**embedding_set**: This function updates an SQLite database with embeddings by inserting new records or replacing existing ones based on a dictionary of content to embedding mappings.

parameters:
· content_to_embedding_dict: A dictionary where keys are strings representing content and values are embeddings (typically lists or arrays) associated with that content.

Code Description: The `embedding_set` method iterates over each key-value pair in the provided dictionary. For each item, it computes an MD5 hash of the key using the `md5_hash` function to generate a unique identifier (`md5_key`). This MD5 key is then used as a primary key in the SQLite database table named `embedding_cache`. The embedding value, which is converted to a JSON string for storage, is paired with this MD5 key. The method executes an SQL command that either inserts a new record or replaces an existing one if the same MD5 key already exists in the table. After processing all items in the dictionary, the changes are committed to the database to ensure they are saved.

Note: This function is crucial for caching embeddings efficiently in an SQLite database, allowing for quick retrieval and reducing redundant computations. It is typically called after generating new embeddings or when updating existing ones, ensuring that the cache remains up-to-date with the latest data. The use of MD5 hashing ensures that content can be uniquely identified without storing the actual content directly in the database, enhancing security and privacy.
***
### FunctionDef message_get(self, conversation_id)
**message_get**: This function retrieves a list of messages associated with a specific conversation ID from an SQLite database.

parameters:
· conversation_id: A string representing the unique identifier for the conversation whose messages are to be retrieved.

Code Description: The function begins by executing an SQL SELECT statement on the 'message_cache' table within the SQLite database. It searches for rows where the 'conversation_id' column matches the provided conversation_id parameter. The query fetches only one row (the first match) due to the use of `fetchone()`. If no matching row is found, indicating that there are no messages for the given conversation ID, the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, it proceeds to parse the 'message' column from the fetched result, which contains a JSON-formatted string representing the list of messages. This JSON string is then converted back into a Python list using `json.loads()` and returned as the output.

Note: The function assumes that the SQLite connection (`self.c`) has already been established elsewhere in the class. It also relies on the 'message_cache' table existing within the database, with at least two columns: 'conversation_id' (of type string) and 'message' (which stores a JSON-formatted string of messages).

Output Example: If the conversation ID provided corresponds to a row where the 'message' column contains the JSON string '["Hello", "How are you?", "I am fine, thank you!"]', then the function will return the list ['Hello', 'How are you?', 'I am fine, thank you!'].
***
### FunctionDef message_set(self, conversation_id, message_value)
**message_set**: This function updates or inserts a message associated with a specific conversation ID into an SQLite database table named `message_cache`.

parameters:
· conversation_id: A string representing the unique identifier for a conversation. This serves as the primary key in the `message_cache` table.
· message_value: A list of strings, where each string is a part of the message to be stored or updated in the cache.

Code Description: The function `message_set` takes two parameters, `conversation_id` and `message_value`. It uses an SQLite cursor (`self.c`) to execute an SQL command. This command either inserts a new record into the `message_cache` table if no record with the given `conversation_id` exists or replaces the existing record if it does. The `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO` statement is used for this purpose. The `message_value`, which is a list of strings, is converted to a JSON string using `json.dumps()` before being stored in the database. This ensures that complex data structures can be serialized and stored efficiently. After executing the SQL command, the function commits the transaction to the database with `self.conn.commit()`. Committing the transaction makes sure that all changes are saved properly.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the SQLite connection (`self.conn`) and cursor (`self.c`) are properly initialized before calling this function. Additionally, developers should handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of SQL commands to maintain robustness in their applications. It is also important to ensure that `conversation_id` is unique for each conversation to prevent unintended data overwrites.
***
## ClassDef SessionChatHistoryCache
**SessionChatHistoryCache**: This class manages caching of chat session histories using a singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists throughout the application. It leverages an SQLite-based lazy cache system to store and retrieve conversation messages.

attributes:
· cache: An instance of SQliteLazyCache configured with a specific cache location defined in LLM_SETTINGS.prompt_cache_path

Code Description: Upon initialization, SessionChatHistoryCache creates an instance of SQliteLazyCache pointing to the designated cache path. The class provides two primary methods for interacting with the chat history cache:

- message_get(conversation_id): This method retrieves all messages associated with a specific conversation ID from the cache and returns them as a list of strings.
- message_set(conversation_id, message_value): This method stores or updates the messages for a given conversation ID in the cache. It takes two parameters: the conversation ID and the new set of messages to store.

The class is designed to be used across different parts of an application where chat session history needs to be managed consistently. By using a singleton pattern, it ensures that all components interact with the same instance of the cache, maintaining data integrity and consistency.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where chat histories need to be retrieved for building new messages or updated after receiving responses from a chat API. This class is particularly useful in applications involving conversational AI, such as chatbots or virtual assistants, where maintaining context across multiple interactions is crucial.

Output Example: When calling message_get with an existing conversation ID, the method might return a list like this:
["Hello!", "How are you?", "I'm fine, thank you!"]

When calling message_set with the same conversation ID and appending a new message, the cache would be updated to include:
["Hello!", "How are you?", "I'm fine, thank you!", "What about you?"]
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the SessionChatHistoryCache class by loading all history conversation JSON files from the specified session cache location.
parameters:
· None: This constructor does not accept any parameters directly.

Code Description: Upon initialization, the function creates an instance of the SQliteLazyCache class. It passes the path to the prompt cache as defined in LLM_SETTINGS.prompt_cache_path to the SQliteLazyCache constructor. The SQliteLazyCache is responsible for handling caching operations using SQLite as its backend storage mechanism. This setup ensures that chat history and related data can be efficiently stored, retrieved, and managed.

The initialization process involves checking if a database file exists at the specified cache location. If it does not exist, the SQliteLazyCache constructor creates three tables within the SQLite database: chat_cache for storing chat data, embedding_cache for embeddings, and message_cache for messages associated with conversation IDs. This setup allows for organized storage of different types of data related to chat sessions.

Note: The use of SQliteLazyCache ensures that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application due to its inheritance from SingletonBaseClass. This design pattern is beneficial for managing shared resources like a database connection efficiently and consistently across various parts of an application. Developers should ensure that the cache_location points to a valid file path where the SQLite database can be created or accessed. Additionally, it's important to note that the SQliteLazyCache does not support multiprocessing due to limitations in sqlite3.
***
### FunctionDef message_get(self, conversation_id)
**message_get**: This function retrieves a list of messages associated with a specific conversation ID from the chat history cache.
parameters:
· conversation_id: A string representing the unique identifier for the conversation whose message history is to be retrieved.

Code Description: The function `message_get` takes a single argument, `conversation_id`, which is used as a key to fetch the corresponding list of messages from an internal cache. This cache presumably stores chat histories for multiple conversations, each identified by a unique conversation ID. The function returns this list of messages, which are likely formatted in a way that represents the sequence of interactions within the specified conversation.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where you need to access the history of a particular conversation, such as when building a response or displaying past interactions. This function is called by other parts of the application, like `build_chat_completion_message`, which uses it to retrieve historical messages before appending new user input to prepare for generating a chat completion.

Output Example: A possible return value from this function could be:
[{"role": "system", "content": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about the weather."}]
***
### FunctionDef message_set(self, conversation_id, message_value)
**message_set**: This function updates the chat history cache for a specific conversation by setting the message list associated with a given conversation ID.

parameters:
· conversation_id: A string representing the unique identifier of the conversation whose messages need to be updated.
· message_value: A list of strings containing the new set of messages that should replace the existing ones in the cache for the specified conversation.

Code Description: The function `message_set` is designed to interact with a caching mechanism, specifically tailored for storing chat history. It takes two parameters: `conversation_id`, which identifies the particular conversation, and `message_value`, which is a list of strings representing the messages that should be stored or updated in the cache under this conversation ID. The function calls an internal method `self.cache.message_set` to perform the actual operation of setting the message list for the given conversation ID.

Note: This function is typically used after a new chat completion has been generated and appended to the existing messages, as seen in the `build_chat_completion` method of the `ChatSession` class. In that context, after generating a response from an API backend, the updated list of messages (including both user prompts and assistant responses) is passed to `message_set` to ensure the chat history is accurately stored for future reference or retrieval. This allows for maintaining a coherent conversation flow across multiple interactions.
***
## ClassDef ChatSession
**ChatSession**: This class manages a chat session by handling conversation history, system prompts, and interactions with an API backend to generate chat completions.

attributes:
· api_backend: An instance of the API backend used for generating chat completions.
· conversation_id: A unique identifier for the chat session. If not provided, it is generated using uuid.uuid4().
· system_prompt: The initial prompt set for the system in the conversation. Defaults to a predefined default_system_prompt if none is provided.

Code Description: The ChatSession class initializes with an API backend and optional parameters for conversation_id and system_prompt. It provides methods to build chat completion messages, calculate tokens from these messages, generate chat completions, retrieve the conversation ID, and display the conversation history (currently not implemented).

The method `build_chat_completion_message` constructs a list of message dictionaries representing the conversation history, including the user's prompt. If no previous messages exist, it starts with a system prompt.

The method `build_chat_completion_message_and_calculate_token` builds the chat completion message and then calculates the number of tokens in these messages using the API backend.

The method `build_chat_completion` generates a chat completion by sending the constructed messages to the API backend. It logs the session, receives a response from the API, appends this response as an assistant's message to the conversation history, and updates the cache with the new history.

The method `get_conversation_id` simply returns the unique identifier for the current chat session.

The method `display_history` is intended to display the conversation history in a user-friendly format but is currently not implemented.

Note: Usage points include initializing a ChatSession object with an API backend, optionally providing a conversation ID and system prompt. Use methods like `build_chat_completion` to generate responses based on user input and manage conversation history.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value from `build_chat_completion` could be:
```
"Sure, how can I assist you today?"
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, api_backend, conversation_id, system_prompt)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the ChatSession class, setting up essential attributes for managing a conversation.

parameters:
· api_backend: The backend API to be used for handling the chat interactions. This could be an object or interface that defines methods for sending and receiving messages.
· conversation_id: An optional string identifier for the conversation. If not provided, a unique UUID will be generated automatically.
· system_prompt: An optional string representing the initial prompt set for the system in the conversation. If not specified, it defaults to LLM_SETTINGS.default_system_prompt.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __init__ method is the constructor of the ChatSession class, responsible for initializing a new chat session with the provided parameters or default values. Upon instantiation, the method checks if a conversation_id has been supplied; if not, it generates a unique identifier using uuid.uuid4() to ensure each session can be uniquely tracked and managed. Similarly, the system_prompt is set either to the value passed during initialization or defaults to a predefined prompt specified in LLM_SETTINGS.default_system_prompt if no custom prompt is provided. The api_backend parameter is directly assigned to an instance variable, which will be used throughout the lifecycle of the ChatSession object for interacting with the chat API.

Note: Usage points.
When creating a new ChatSession, developers can optionally specify a conversation_id and system_prompt to customize the session according to their needs. If these parameters are omitted, the session will automatically receive a unique identifier and use a default system prompt as defined in LLM_SETTINGS.default_system_prompt. This flexibility allows for both generic and tailored chat interactions within applications that utilize this class.
***
### FunctionDef build_chat_completion_message(self, user_prompt)
**build_chat_completion_message**: This function constructs a list of messages suitable for generating a chat completion response. It retrieves any existing conversation history from the cache, ensures an initial system prompt is included if no previous messages exist, and appends the user's latest prompt to this list.

parameters:
· user_prompt: A string representing the current input or question provided by the user in the chat session.

Code Description: The function starts by obtaining the message history for the current conversation using `SessionChatHistoryCache().message_get(self.conversation_id)`. If no messages are found (indicating a new conversation), it initializes the list with a system prompt stored in `self.system_prompt`. Regardless of whether there were previous messages, the user's latest input is appended to the list as a message with the role "user". This structured list of messages is then returned and can be used for generating chat completions.

Note: This function is crucial for maintaining context in conversational AI applications. It ensures that each new response from the system takes into account all previous interactions, providing coherent and relevant answers. The function is typically called before sending a request to an API that generates chat responses based on the provided message history.

Output Example: A possible return value from this function could be:
[{"role": "system", "content": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about the weather."}]
***
### FunctionDef build_chat_completion_message_and_calculate_token(self, user_prompt)
**build_chat_completion_message_and_calculate_token**: This function orchestrates the creation of a chat completion message list from a user's prompt and calculates the total number of tokens required to represent these messages using an API backend.

parameters:
· user_prompt: A string representing the current input or question provided by the user in the chat session.

Code Description: The function first constructs a list of messages suitable for generating a chat completion response by calling `build_chat_completion_message(user_prompt)`. This involves retrieving any existing conversation history, ensuring an initial system prompt is included if no previous messages exist, and appending the user's latest prompt to this list. After constructing the message list, the function then calculates the total number of tokens required for these messages using `api_backend.calculate_token_from_messages(messages)`. The token calculation takes into account the specific model being used, adjusting counts based on the model's requirements.

Note: This function is essential for preparing chat completion requests and estimating their cost or feasibility in terms of API usage limits. It ensures that each request includes all necessary context from previous interactions and accurately reflects the resource requirements for processing.

Output Example: If the user_prompt is "What is the weather like today?", and assuming a conversation history with an initial system prompt, the function might return a token count such as 45 tokens. This count would be based on the combined length of all messages in the conversation, including the new user prompt, encoded according to the model's specifications.

### FunctionDef build_chat_completion(self, user_prompt)
**build_chat_completion**: This function constructs a chat completion response by building session messages from a user prompt and any existing conversation history, then sending these messages to an API backend for processing. The response is appended to the conversation history cache.

parameters:
· user_prompt: A string representing the current input or question provided by the user in the chat session.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that are passed to the API backend responsible for generating the chat completion.

Code Description: The function begins by calling `build_chat_completion_message` with the user prompt to construct a list of messages. This list includes any existing conversation history retrieved from the cache and the new user prompt formatted as a message with the role "user". If no previous messages exist, an initial system prompt is added to start the conversation.

The constructed messages are then passed to the API backend through `_try_create_chat_completion_or_embedding` with `chat_completion=True`. This function handles the request to generate a chat completion and includes retry logic in case of errors. The response from the API backend, which represents the assistant's reply, is appended to the list of messages as a new message with the role "assistant".

Finally, the updated list of messages, now including both user prompts and assistant responses, is stored back in the cache using `SessionChatHistoryCache().message_set`. This ensures that the conversation history remains up-to-date for future interactions. The function returns the assistant's response to be used as needed.

Note: This function is essential for maintaining context in conversational AI applications. It ensures that each new response from the system takes into account all previous interactions, providing coherent and relevant answers. The function is typically called whenever a user submits a new prompt in a chat session.

Output Example: If the user_prompt is "What is quantum computing?", the function might return a string like "Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data." The conversation history cache would then be updated to include both the user's prompt and the assistant's response.
***
### FunctionDef get_conversation_id(self)
**get_conversation_id**: This function retrieves the unique identifier associated with a conversation session.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `get_conversation_id` method is designed to return a string that represents the unique conversation ID of an instance. This ID is stored in the `conversation_id` attribute of the class instance and is used to identify specific conversations within the application or system. By calling this method, developers can easily access the conversation ID without directly interacting with the internal attributes of the object.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where tracking or referencing a particular conversation is necessary, such as logging, analytics, or session management in chat applications or similar systems.

Output Example: "conv123456789" - This string represents a possible unique identifier that could be returned by the `get_conversation_id` method.
***
### FunctionDef display_history(self)
**display_history**: This function is intended to present the history of messages in a visually appealing format within a chat session context.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters as it operates on the internal state of the ChatSession object.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `display_history` method is part of a class, likely named `ChatSession`, which manages the flow and storage of messages in a chat environment. Currently, this method is defined but not implemented, as indicated by the `pass` statement and the TODO comment suggesting that a "beautiful presentation format for history messages" needs to be realized.

The function's purpose is to output or render the conversation history stored within the ChatSession instance. This could involve formatting the text of past messages, possibly including timestamps, sender identifiers, and any other relevant metadata in a user-friendly manner. The implementation would depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as whether it is intended for a command-line interface, a web-based chat application, or another type of user interface.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should implement this function to provide users with an easy-to-read and organized view of their conversation history. This could enhance user experience by making it simple to review past interactions without having to scroll through the entire chat window manually. When implementing this feature, consider the target audience's needs and preferences for message presentation, such as color coding, font styles, or interactive elements that can help users navigate through the chat history efficiently.

### FunctionDef _get_encoder(self)
**_get_encoder**: This function retrieves a text encoder suitable for tokenizing input text based on the specified chat model. It handles cases where the default method `tiktoken.encoding_for_model` might fail, particularly when dealing with Azure API deployment names that do not conform to expected formats.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the instance variable `self.chat_model`.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function `_get_encoder` is designed to obtain a text encoder for tokenizing input text, which is essential for processing natural language inputs in machine learning models. It primarily uses the `tiktoken.encoding_for_model` method provided by the tiktoken library. However, this method may not handle all model names correctly, especially when using Azure's API where deployment names can be customized and do not strictly follow standard naming conventions.

The function first attempts to retrieve the encoder directly using the `self.chat_model` attribute. If a `KeyError` is raised (indicating that the model name is not recognized by `tiktoken.encoding_for_model`), it logs a warning message indicating the failure and proceeds to apply patches to the model name. Currently, only one patch function `_azure_patch` is implemented, which replaces underscores with hyphens in the model name. This adjustment aims to align Azure deployment names with expected formats that `tiktoken.encoding_for_model` can process.

If applying the patch still results in a `KeyError`, an error message is logged, and the exception is re-raised, indicating that no suitable encoder could be found for the given model name.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically called during the initialization of an APIBackend instance when setting up the text encoder. It ensures that the correct tokenizer is available for processing input text according to the specified chat model, even in cases where the model name might not conform to standard formats expected by the tiktoken library.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The function returns an instance of a `tiktoken.Encoding` object. This object provides methods for encoding and decoding text into tokens, which are necessary for feeding input data into language models. Here is a mock-up of what the returned object might look like:

```
Encoding(
    name='cl100k_base',
    explicit_n_vocab=50281,
    pat_str='(?i)<|endoftext|>|<|fim_prefix|>|<|fim_suffix|>|<|fim_middle|>|<|beginofname|>|<|endofname|>|<|mask|>|[\\u0000-\\u007F]|[\\u0100-\\uFFFF]|(?:[\uD800-\uDBFF][\uDC00-\uDFFF])',
    mergeable_ranks={b'\x00\x00': 49406, b'\x00\x01': 32767, ...},
    special_tokens={'<|endoftext|>': 50256, '<|fim_prefix|>': 50281, ...}
)
```

This example illustrates the structure of a `tiktoken.Encoding` object, which includes metadata about the encoding scheme and mappings between tokens and their corresponding byte sequences.
#### FunctionDef _azure_patch(model)
**_azure_patch**: This function processes a model name string to be compatible with the tiktoken library when using Azure's API. It specifically addresses an issue where Azure allows deployment names containing underscores, which tiktoken does not support.

parameters:
· model: A string representing the model name or deployment identifier used in Azure's API. This string may include characters such as underscores (e.g., `gpt-4o_2024-08-06`).

Code Description: The function takes a single argument, `model`, which is expected to be a string. It then replaces all underscores (`_`) in this string with hyphens (`-`). This replacement is necessary because the tiktoken library used for token encoding does not recognize model names containing underscores, leading to errors when attempting to encode tokens for models specified with such names.

Note: Usage of this function is crucial when integrating Azure's API with applications that rely on tiktoken for handling text data. By ensuring the model name is in a format compatible with tiktoken, developers can avoid runtime errors and ensure smooth operation of their applications.

Output Example: If the input to `_azure_patch` is `gpt-4o_2024-08-06`, the function will return `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`. However, if the input includes an underscore, such as `gpt-4o_2024-08-06_test`, the output will be `gpt-4o-2024-08-06-test`.

### FunctionDef build_chat_session(self, conversation_id, session_system_prompt)
**build_chat_session**: This function initializes a new chat session by creating an instance of the ChatSession class. It accepts optional parameters to specify the conversation ID and system prompt, which are used to manage and customize the chat session.

parameters:
· conversation_id: A unique identifier for the chat session. If not provided, it is generated using uuid.uuid4(). This ID is also used as the filename under the session_cache_folder/ directory for storing the conversation history.
· session_system_prompt: An initial prompt set for the system in the conversation. If no prompt is provided, a default system prompt defined in LLM_SETTINGS.default_system_prompt will be used.

Code Description: The function takes two optional parameters and returns an instance of the ChatSession class. It passes these parameters to the ChatSession constructor along with the current API backend instance (self). Inside the ChatSession class, if no conversation_id is provided, a new one is generated using uuid.uuid4(). Similarly, if no system prompt is given, it defaults to LLM_SETTINGS.default_system_prompt. The ChatSession object manages the chat session by handling conversation history, system prompts, and interactions with an API backend to generate chat completions.

Note: Usage points include initializing a chat session with or without specifying a conversation ID and system prompt. This function is essential for setting up new conversations or resuming existing ones based on their unique identifiers.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
<ChatSession object at 0x7f9c3b2a4d50>
```
This output represents an instance of the ChatSession class, which can then be used to manage and interact with a chat session.
***
### FunctionDef build_messages(self, user_prompt, system_prompt, former_messages)
**build_messages**: Constructs a list of message dictionaries formatted for chat completion APIs by combining system prompts, user prompts, and any previous messages while optionally cleaning up excessive line breaks.

parameters:
· user_prompt: A string representing the current user's input or question.
· system_prompt: An optional string that sets the behavior or context of the assistant. If not provided, a default system prompt from LLM_SETTINGS is used.
· former_messages: An optional list of dictionaries containing previous messages in the conversation. Each dictionary should have 'role' and 'content' keys.
· shrink_multiple_break: A boolean flag indicating whether to reduce multiple consecutive line breaks (more than two) in both user_prompt and system_prompt to just two.

Code Description: The function first checks if former_messages is None and initializes it as an empty list if so. If shrink_multiple_break is True, the function iteratively removes any instances of three or more consecutive newline characters from both user_prompt and system_prompt, replacing them with two newlines. It then sets the system prompt to a default value defined in LLM_SETTINGS if no custom system prompt is provided. The messages list is initialized with a dictionary representing the system message. If former_messages are present, they are appended to the messages list, but only up to a maximum number of past messages as specified by LLM_SETTINGS.max_past_message_include. Finally, the user's current prompt is added to the messages list as a new dictionary entry.

Note: This function is typically used in conjunction with chat completion APIs where message history and formatting are crucial for generating coherent responses. It helps in maintaining context across multiple interactions and ensures that the input data adheres to expected formats.

Output Example: 
[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how can I assist you today?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can help with information and tasks. What do you need?"}
]
***
### FunctionDef build_messages_and_create_chat_completion(self, user_prompt, system_prompt, former_messages, chat_cache_prefix)
**build_messages_and_create_chat_completion**: This function constructs a list of messages formatted for chat completion APIs by combining system prompts, user prompts, and any previous messages. It then attempts to create a chat completion using these messages.

parameters:
· user_prompt: A string representing the current user's input or question.
· system_prompt: An optional string that sets the behavior or context of the assistant. If not provided, a default system prompt is used.
· former_messages: An optional list of dictionaries containing previous messages in the conversation. Each dictionary should have 'role' and 'content' keys.
· chat_cache_prefix: A string prefix for caching purposes, which can be useful for storing and retrieving cached chat completions.
· shrink_multiple_break: A boolean flag indicating whether to reduce multiple consecutive line breaks (more than two) in both user_prompt and system_prompt to just two. Defaults to False.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that are passed to the function responsible for creating chat completions.

Code Description: The function first checks if former_messages is None and initializes it as an empty list if so. It then calls the build_messages method with the provided user_prompt, system_prompt, former_messages, and shrink_multiple_break flag to construct a properly formatted list of messages. This list includes the system prompt, any previous messages up to a specified limit, and the current user's prompt.

After constructing the messages, the function calls _try_create_chat_completion_or_embedding with the constructed messages, setting chat_completion=True to indicate that it should attempt to create a chat completion. The chat_cache_prefix is passed along for caching purposes, and any additional keyword arguments are forwarded as well. This method handles retries in case of errors during the creation process.

Note: This function is essential for maintaining context across multiple interactions with an AI assistant. It ensures that the input data adheres to expected formats and handles potential errors gracefully by retrying operations.

Output Example: If called with user_prompt="What is quantum computing?", system_prompt=None, former_messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there!"}], chat_cache_prefix="chat123", and shrink_multiple_break=True, the function might return a string like "Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data."
***
### FunctionDef create_embedding(self, input_content)
**create_embedding**: This function generates embeddings from input text data. It accepts either a single string or a list of strings as input and returns the corresponding embedding(s). The function handles both individual and batch processing seamlessly.

parameters:
· input_content: A string or a list of strings representing the text for which embeddings are to be created.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to customize the embedding creation process, such as model specifications or other parameters supported by the underlying API.

Code Description: The function first checks if the `input_content` is a single string. If so, it converts it into a list containing just that string for uniform processing. It then calls the `_try_create_chat_completion_or_embedding` method with the input content and sets the `embedding` flag to True. This method handles the actual creation of embeddings, including retries in case of errors.

If the original input was a single string, the function returns only the first element from the response list (since the response is always a list). If the input was already a list, it returns the entire list of embeddings corresponding to each input string.

Note: This function is designed to be robust against transient errors by leveraging the retry mechanism implemented in `_try_create_chat_completion_or_embedding`. It ensures that embedding creation attempts are retried up to a specified number of times if initial attempts fail due to issues like network problems or API rate limits.

Output Example: If called with `input_content="hello world"`, the function might return an embedding vector such as `[0.1, 0.2, -0.3]`. If called with `input_content=["hello", "world"]`, it could return a list of embeddings like `[[0.1, 0.2], [0.4, 0.5]]`.
***
### FunctionDef _create_chat_completion_auto_continue(self, messages)
**_create_chat_completion_auto_continue**: This function generates a chat completion by calling an inner function and automatically continues the conversation if the response is cut off due to length constraints.

parameters:
· messages: A list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains at least two keys: 'role' and 'content'. These represent the role of the message sender (e.g., user, assistant) and the actual message text.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to customize the behavior of the chat completion process. These may include parameters like temperature, max_tokens, frequency_penalty, presence_penalty, json_mode, add_json_in_prompt, and seed.

Code Description: The function starts by calling `_create_chat_completion_inner_function` with the provided messages and any additional keyword arguments. It captures both the response and the finish reason from this call. If the finish reason indicates that the response was cut off due to length ("length"), the function constructs a new list of messages that includes the original messages, the initial response, and an instruction for the assistant to continue the output without overlap. It then calls `_create_chat_completion_inner_function` again with these updated messages and keyword arguments. The final result is a concatenation of the initial response and any additional content generated in the continuation.

Note: This function currently only handles one continuation. Future enhancements may allow for multiple continuations if needed. Additionally, it relies on the inner function to handle caching, logging, and interactions with different models or endpoints based on configuration settings.

Output Example: For a list of messages like `[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."}]`, the function might return a detailed explanation of quantum computing. If the initial response is cut off due to length constraints, it will automatically request and append additional content until the full explanation is provided. The final output could be a comprehensive string explaining quantum computing without any overlap between the initial and continued responses.
***
### FunctionDef _try_create_chat_completion_or_embedding(self, max_retry)
**_try_create_chat_completion_or_embedding**: This function attempts to create either a chat completion or an embedding based on the specified parameters, retrying up to a maximum number of times if it encounters errors.

parameters:
· max_retry: An integer specifying the maximum number of retries in case of failure. Defaults to 10.
· chat_completion: A boolean indicating whether to attempt creating a chat completion. Cannot be True if embedding is also True.
· embedding: A boolean indicating whether to attempt creating an embedding. Cannot be True if chat_completion is also True.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that are passed to the inner functions responsible for creating chat completions or embeddings.

Code Description: The function first asserts that both `chat_completion` and `embedding` cannot be True simultaneously, as these operations are mutually exclusive. It then sets the maximum number of retries based on a configuration setting (`LLM_SETTINGS.max_retry`) if it is defined; otherwise, it uses the provided `max_retry` parameter.

The function enters a loop that runs up to `max_retry` times. Within this loop, it tries to create either a chat completion or an embedding depending on the specified parameters:
- If `embedding` is True, it calls `_create_embedding_inner_function` with the provided keyword arguments.
- If `chat_completion` is True, it calls `_create_chat_completion_auto_continue` with the provided keyword arguments.

If a `BadRequestError` occurs during these calls, the function logs the error and retries. It includes specific handling for certain error messages:
- If the error message contains "'messages' must contain the word 'json' in some form", it adds an `add_json_in_prompt` flag to the keyword arguments.
- If the error is related to exceeding the maximum context length during embedding creation, it halves the content of each string in the `input_content_list`.

For any other exceptions, the function logs the error and retries after a delay specified by `self.retry_wait_seconds`.

If all retry attempts fail, the function raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the operation could not be completed.

Note: This function is designed to handle transient errors gracefully by retrying operations. It also includes specific logic to address known issues with certain types of errors, such as missing JSON in prompts or exceeding context length limits during embedding creation.

Output Example: If called with `chat_completion=True` and appropriate keyword arguments, the function might return a string like "Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data." If called with `embedding=True` and an input list ["hello world"], it could return a list of embeddings like [[0.1, 0.2]].
***
### FunctionDef _create_embedding_inner_function(self, input_content_list)
**_create_embedding_inner_function**: This function generates embeddings for a list of input strings. It utilizes caching mechanisms to avoid redundant computations by retrieving precomputed embeddings from an SQLite database when possible. If caching is not enabled or if no cached embedding exists, it creates new embeddings using an API client.

parameters:
· input_content_list: A list of strings for which embeddings are to be generated.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to the function (currently unused in this implementation).

Code Description: The function starts by initializing a dictionary `content_to_embedding_dict` to store content and its corresponding embedding, and an empty list `filtered_input_content_list` to hold input strings that do not have cached embeddings. If caching is enabled (`self.use_embedding_cache`), it iterates over the `input_content_list`, checking each string against the cache using the `embedding_get` method of the `SQliteLazyCache` class. If a cached embedding is found, it adds the content and its embedding to `content_to_embedding_dict`. Otherwise, it appends the content to `filtered_input_content_list`.

If caching is disabled or if there are any strings in `filtered_input_content_list`, the function proceeds to generate embeddings for these strings. It slices the list into smaller chunks based on a predefined maximum number of strings (`LLM_SETTINGS.embedding_max_str_num`) that can be processed at once. For each chunk, it calls the API client's `embeddings.create` method to generate embeddings. The response from the API is then parsed and stored in `content_to_embedding_dict`.

If embedding caching is enabled (`self.dump_embedding_cache`), the function updates the cache with the newly generated embeddings using the `embedding_set` method of the `SQliteLazyCache` class.

Finally, the function returns a list of embeddings corresponding to the original order of strings in `input_content_list`, retrieved from `content_to_embedding_dict`.

Note: This function is typically used within larger systems that require embedding generation for natural language processing tasks. It efficiently handles caching and batching to optimize performance and reduce redundant API calls.

Output Example: For an input list ["hello world", "openai"], if the embeddings are [0.1, 0.2] and [0.3, 0.4] respectively, the function would return [[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]]. If caching is enabled and "hello world" has a cached embedding of [0.1, 0.2], it will retrieve this value from the cache instead of generating it again.

### FunctionDef _build_log_messages(self, messages)
**_build_log_messages**: This function constructs a formatted string from a list of message dictionaries intended for logging purposes. Each message dictionary is expected to contain 'role' and 'content' keys, representing the role of the speaker (e.g., user, assistant) and the content of their message, respectively.

parameters:
· messages: A list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains at least two keys: 'role' and 'content'. These represent the role of the message sender and the actual message text.

Code Description: The function initializes an empty string `log_messages`. It then iterates over each dictionary in the provided `messages` list. For each dictionary, it appends a formatted string to `log_messages`. This formatted string includes the 'role' and 'content' of the message, with specific colors applied for better readability when logged. The role is displayed in bold magenta, while the content follows in cyan. After processing all messages, the function returns the complete `log_messages` string.

Note: This function is used to prepare log entries that include chat messages, making it easier to trace and understand interactions within a conversation system. It leverages color codes defined in the `LogColors` class to enhance the visual distinction between different parts of the log message when viewed in a console or terminal that supports ANSI escape sequences.

Output Example: Given a list of messages like `[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm fine, thank you!"}]`, the function would return a string formatted as follows:

```
Role:user
Content: Hello, how are you?
Role:assistant
Content: I'm fine, thank you!
```

### FunctionDef _create_chat_completion_inner_function(self, messages, temperature, max_tokens, chat_cache_prefix, frequency_penalty, presence_penalty)
**_create_chat_completion_inner_function**: This function handles the creation of chat completions by interacting with different models based on configuration settings. It supports caching to avoid redundant API calls, logging for debugging purposes, and various parameters to customize the behavior of the completion process.

parameters:
· messages: A list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains at least two keys: 'role' and 'content'. These represent the role of the message sender (e.g., user, assistant) and the actual message text.
· temperature: An optional float that controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits before applying softmax. Lower values make the model more deterministic.
· max_tokens: An optional integer specifying the maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.
· chat_cache_prefix: A string prefix used for caching purposes, helping to distinguish different types of cache entries.
· frequency_penalty: An optional float that penalizes new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far. Higher values decrease the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
· presence_penalty: An optional float that penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far. Higher values make it less likely to generate tokens that have already appeared.
· json_mode: A boolean flag indicating whether the response should be in JSON format.
· add_json_in_prompt: A boolean flag indicating whether to instruct the model to respond in JSON format by appending a request to each message in reverse order until a system role is encountered.
· seed: An optional integer used for seeding the local cache mechanism, ensuring that retries with caching enabled return different results.

Code Description: The function first checks if a seed value is provided or if automatic seed generation is enabled. If neither is set, it uses a default seed generator. It logs the chat messages if logging is enabled and prepares an input content string for caching purposes by appending the seed to the JSON-serialized messages. If caching is enabled, it attempts to retrieve a cached response using the prepared key. If a cache hit occurs, it returns the cached response.

If no cached response is found, the function sets default values for parameters if they are not provided. It then determines which model or endpoint to use based on configuration settings and caller context. For LLaMA2, it calls the chat completion method directly with specified parameters. For a GCR (Generic Cloud Run) endpoint, it constructs a request body, sends an HTTP POST request, and processes the response.

For other models, it prepares keyword arguments for the chat completion API call, including handling JSON mode instructions if applicable. If streaming is enabled, it processes each chunk of the response, logging content as it arrives and concatenating it into a final response string. Otherwise, it retrieves the complete response from the first choice in the API result.

After generating or retrieving the response, the function logs the response details if logging is enabled. If caching is enabled, it stores the response in the cache using the prepared key. Finally, it returns the response and the finish reason (if applicable).

Note: This function is designed to be flexible and robust, supporting various configurations and models while providing mechanisms for caching and logging to enhance performance and traceability.

Output Example: For a list of messages like `[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]`, the function might return a tuple with the response string `"I'm fine, thank you!"` and the finish reason `"stop"`. If caching is enabled and the same input is provided again, it could return the cached response directly without calling the model API.

### FunctionDef calculate_token_from_messages(self, messages)
**calculate_token_from_messages**: This function calculates the total number of tokens required to represent a list of messages based on the model being used. It is designed to handle different models like GPT-4 and others, adjusting token counts accordingly.

**parameters**:
· messages: A list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a message with keys such as "role", "name", and "content".

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the model in use is LLaMA2 or using a GCR endpoint. If so, it logs a warning indicating that token calculation for this model is not yet implemented and returns 0. For other models, particularly those with 'gpt4' in their name, it sets specific token counts per message and per name. It then iterates over each message in the provided list, adding tokens based on the content length (encoded) and whether a name field exists. Finally, it adds an additional 3 tokens to account for the assistant's response format.

**Note**: This function is crucial for managing API calls efficiently by estimating the token usage before sending requests, which helps in avoiding exceeding the model's token limit or budget constraints.

**Output Example**: If the input messages are [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'Alice', 'content': 'Hi there!'}], and assuming a GPT-4 model, the function might return 23 tokens. This includes base tokens for each message, encoded content length, and additional tokens for the assistant's response format.

### FunctionDef build_messages_and_calculate_token(self, user_prompt, system_prompt, former_messages)
**build_messages_and_calculate_token**: This function constructs a list of message dictionaries formatted for chat completion APIs by combining system prompts, user prompts, and any previous messages while optionally cleaning up excessive line breaks. It then calculates the total number of tokens required to represent these messages based on the model being used.

parameters:
· user_prompt: A string representing the current user's input or question.
· system_prompt: An optional string that sets the behavior or context of the assistant. If not provided, a default system prompt from LLM_SETTINGS is used.
· former_messages: An optional list of dictionaries containing previous messages in the conversation. Each dictionary should have 'role' and 'content' keys.
· shrink_multiple_break: A boolean flag indicating whether to reduce multiple consecutive line breaks (more than two) in both user_prompt and system_prompt to just two.

Code Description: The function first checks if former_messages is None and initializes it as an empty list if so. It then calls the build_messages method with the provided parameters, which constructs a properly formatted list of messages. This includes handling any necessary cleanup of excessive line breaks based on the shrink_multiple_break flag. After constructing the messages, the function proceeds to calculate the total number of tokens required for these messages by calling the calculate_token_from_messages method. This calculation is crucial for managing API calls efficiently and ensuring that token usage does not exceed model limits.

Note: This function is typically used in conjunction with chat completion APIs where message history and formatting are crucial for generating coherent responses. It helps in maintaining context across multiple interactions and ensures that the input data adheres to expected formats while also providing an estimate of the token cost associated with the messages.

Output Example: If the input parameters are user_prompt="Hello, how can I assist you today?", system_prompt=None (using default), former_messages=[{"role": "assistant", "content": "I can help with information and tasks. What do you need?"}], and shrink_multiple_break=False, the function might return 23 tokens. This includes base tokens for each message, encoded content length, and additional tokens for the assistant's response format.
