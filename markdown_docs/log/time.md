## FunctionDef measure_time(method)
**measure_time**: This function is a decorator designed to measure the execution time of any given method it wraps around. It logs the duration taken by the method to execute, providing insights into performance.

parameters:
· method: The function or method whose execution time needs to be measured.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `measure_time` function takes another function (`method`) as an argument and returns a new function (`timed`). This returned function wraps around the original method, adding functionality to measure its execution time. When the wrapped function is called, it records the start time using `time.time()`, executes the original method with any provided arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`), then records the end time immediately after the method completes. The duration of the method's execution is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time. The name of the method being measured is obtained via `method.__name__`. Finally, it logs this information using a logging function (`logger.info`) indicating how long the method took to execute in seconds, formatted to two decimal places. The result of the original method call is then returned.

Note: Usage points.
This decorator can be applied to any function or method where you need to measure and log its execution time. It's particularly useful for performance analysis and optimization efforts. To use this decorator, simply place `@measure_time` above the definition of the function you wish to monitor.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If the decorated function is named `process_data`, and it takes 1.2345 seconds to execute, the log output would be:
"process_data took 1.23 sec"

The actual return value from `process_data` would still be returned as usual by the decorator, unaffected by the timing or logging functionality added.
### FunctionDef timed
**timed**: This function measures the execution time of another function named `method`. It logs how long it takes to execute the function, providing a simple way to profile performance.

parameters:
· *args: Variable length argument list that is passed to the `method` being timed.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments that are also passed to the `method`.

Code Description: The `timed` function starts by recording the current time using `time.time()`, which returns the number of seconds since the epoch. It then calls the `method` with all positional and keyword arguments provided (`*args` and `**kwargs`). After the method execution, it records the end time again. By subtracting the start time from the end time, it calculates the duration that the `method` took to execute. The name of the method is retrieved using `method.__name__`, which is then used in a log message indicating how long the method took to run. This information is logged at the info level using `logger.info()`. Finally, the function returns the result of the `method`.

Note: Usage points include wrapping any function with this decorator-like pattern to measure its execution time. The actual logging mechanism relies on an external logger object named `logger`, which should be properly configured elsewhere in the application.

Output Example: If a method called `process_data` is wrapped and takes 2.34 seconds to execute, the log output would look like:
process_data took 2.34 sec
