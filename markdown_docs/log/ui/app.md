## FunctionDef filter_log_folders(main_log_path)
**filter_log_folders**: This function filters out subfolders within a specified main log directory to identify which ones contain a valid "__session__" folder, indicating they are considered valid for display on a webpage.

parameters:
· main_log_path: A Path object representing the main directory where log folders are located. This path is used as the root from which all subdirectories will be evaluated.

Code Description: The function begins by generating a list of folders within the main log directory that meet specific criteria. It iterates over each item in the main_log_path using the `iterdir()` method, checking if the item is a directory and contains a "__session__" folder. This check ensures that only directories with a "__session__" subfolder are considered valid. The `relative_to(main_log_path)` method is used to store paths relative to the main log path, making it easier to manage and display these paths in a user interface context.

After identifying all valid folders, the function sorts them alphabetically by their names using Python's built-in `sorted()` function with a lambda function as the key. This sorting step ensures that the list of valid folders is presented in an organized manner, which can be particularly useful for user interfaces where folder order might affect usability or readability.

The sorted list of relative paths to the valid log folders is then returned by the function. These paths can be used directly in a web application to display only those folders that contain session data, thereby filtering out any irrelevant directories.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where a system needs to present users with a selection of log folders that have associated session data, such as in a logging or monitoring dashboard. The function assumes that the main_log_path is correctly provided and contains subdirectories that may or may not contain "__session__" folders.

Output Example: A possible return value from this function could be:
[PosixPath('logs/2023-10-01/__session__'), PosixPath('logs/2023-10-05/__session__')]
This output indicates that within the main log directory, there are two valid subfolders named '2023-10-01' and '2023-10-05', each containing a "__session__" folder.
## FunctionDef should_display(msg)
**should_display**: This function determines whether a given message should be displayed based on its tags and content type.

parameters:
· msg: An instance of the Message class, which contains information about the message including its tag and content.

Code Description: The function iterates over each tag in the state's excluded_tags list. It checks if any of these tags are present in the message's tag (which is split by periods to allow for hierarchical tag matching). If a match is found, the function returns False, indicating that the message should not be displayed.

Next, the function checks if the type name of the message's content is listed in the state's excluded_types list. If it is, the function again returns False, signifying that the message should not be displayed due to its content type.

If neither of these conditions are met (i.e., none of the excluded tags are found in the message's tag and the content type is not excluded), the function returns True, indicating that the message should be displayed.

Note: This function is used within the get_msgs_until function to filter messages based on predefined criteria before processing them further. It helps in managing which messages are relevant for the current context or scenario being handled by the application.

Output Example: If a message has a tag "info.debug" and this tag is not in the excluded_tags list, and its content type is not in the excluded_types list, then should_display will return True, allowing the message to be processed further. Conversely, if either condition fails, it returns False, effectively filtering out that message from display or further processing.
## FunctionDef get_msgs_until(end_func)
**get_msgs_until**: This function retrieves messages from a file storage system until a specified condition is met. It processes each message based on its tags and updates various states accordingly.

parameters:
· end_func: A callable that takes a Message object as an argument and returns a boolean value. The iteration stops when this function returns True for a given message. By default, it is set to always return True, meaning the loop will continue indefinitely unless explicitly stopped by another condition.

Code Description: The function starts by checking if `state.fs` (file storage) is available. If so, it enters an infinite loop where it attempts to retrieve messages one by one using `next(state.fs)`. Each message is first checked with the `should_display` function to determine if it should be processed further.

If a message passes the display check, its tags are split and used to update various states:
- If the tag contains "r" but not already in `state.current_tags`, it increments the logical round counter (`state.lround`).
- If the tag includes "evolving code", it updates the evolving rounds counter for the current logical round.

The function then updates `state.current_tags` and `state.last_msg` with the message's tags and content, respectively. Depending on the message's tags, different actions are taken:
- For messages tagged with "model runner result", "factor runner result", or "runner result", it processes metrics related to model scenarios and appends them to `state.metric_series`.
- Messages tagged with "hypothesis generation" update the hypotheses for the current logical round.
- Tags containing both "ef" and "feedback" update the evolving feedback decisions.
- Tags including "d" handle decision-making messages, filtering out empty content if necessary.

The function also updates timestamps for different stages of processing (init, r, d, ef) in `state.times`.

Finally, the loop checks if the message meets the condition specified by `end_func`. If it does, the loop breaks. If there are no more messages to process (`StopIteration` is raised), a toast notification informs the user that there are no more logs.

Note: This function is crucial for processing and managing log messages in the application, ensuring that only relevant messages are handled and that various states are updated correctly based on message content and tags. It serves as a core component in handling dynamic scenarios and updating the application's state accordingly.
## FunctionDef refresh(same_trace)
**refresh**: This function refreshes the application state by reinitializing various state variables and optionally detecting scenario information from log messages.

parameters:
· same_trace: A boolean flag indicating whether to reuse the existing trace or detect a new scenario. If set to False, the function will attempt to detect scenario information from the log messages.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if `state.log_path` is None. If it is, a toast notification prompts the user to set the log path and exits early. Otherwise, it initializes the file storage system (`state.fs`) using the provided log path. This involves creating an instance of `FileStorage` that iterates over messages.

Next, the function checks if `same_trace` is False. If so, it calls `get_msgs_until`, a helper function that retrieves messages until a non-string content message is encountered. This step is crucial for detecting scenario information. If no scenario information is detected (i.e., `state.last_msg` is None or its content is not an instance of `Scenario`), a toast notification informs the user, and `state.scenario` is set to None. Otherwise, it sets `state.scenario` to the detected scenario's content and confirms this with a toast notification.

After handling scenario detection, the function resets several state variables:
- `state.msgs`: A nested dictionary for storing messages.
- `state.lround`: A counter for logical rounds.
- `state.erounds`: A dictionary tracking evolving rounds per logical round.
- `state.e_decisions`: A nested dictionary for storing evolving feedback decisions.
- `state.hypotheses`: A dictionary for hypotheses per logical round.
- `state.h_decisions`: A dictionary indicating whether hypotheses have been decided.
- `state.metric_series`: A list for storing metric series data.
- `state.last_msg`: The last processed message.
- `state.current_tags`: Tags of the last processed message.
- `state.alpha158_metrics`: Metrics related to alpha158 experiments.
- `state.times`: A nested dictionary tracking timestamps for different stages of processing.

Note: This function is essential for resetting and updating the application's state based on log messages. It ensures that the application can handle new scenarios or refresh its state without retaining previous data unless specified by the `same_trace` parameter.

Output Example: Upon calling `refresh(same_trace=False)`, if a scenario is detected, the output might include toast notifications indicating successful scenario detection and resetting of various states. If no scenario is detected, it will notify the user to set up a log path or provide valid scenario information. The internal state variables such as `state.scenario`, `state.msgs`, and others are reset accordingly.
## FunctionDef evolving_feedback_window(wsf)
**evolving_feedback_window**: This function creates a user interface using Streamlit to display feedback from different aspects of a model or factor evaluation process. Depending on whether the input is an instance of `FactorSingleFeedback` or `ModelSingleFeedback`, it organizes and presents feedback into distinct tabs.

**parameters**:
· wsf: An object that can be either an instance of `FactorSingleFeedback` or `ModelSingleFeedback`. This object contains various types of feedback related to a factor or model evaluation.

**Code Description**: The function starts by checking the type of the input object `wsf`. If it is an instance of `FactorSingleFeedback`, it creates four tabs labeled "Final Feedback🏁", "Execution Feedback🖥️", "Code Feedback📄", and "Value Feedback🔢". Each tab displays a specific type of feedback using Streamlit's markdown or code display functions. For example, the final feedback is displayed in markdown format within the first tab.

If `wsf` is an instance of `ModelSingleFeedback`, an additional tab labeled "Model Shape Feedback📐" is included between the "Code Feedback📄" and "Value Feedback🔢" tabs. Similar to the previous case, each tab displays its respective type of feedback. The function uses Streamlit's tab functionality to organize these different types of feedback in a user-friendly manner.

**Note**: This function is designed to be called within a Streamlit application context where `FactorSingleFeedback` and `ModelSingleFeedback` objects are available. It assumes that the necessary Streamlit library (`st`) has been imported and initialized. The function is particularly useful for scenarios involving model or factor evaluation, providing a clear and organized way to present various types of feedback to users.
## FunctionDef display_hypotheses(hypotheses, decisions, success_only)
Doc is waiting to be generated...
### FunctionDef style_rows(row)
**style_rows**: This function applies CSS styling to rows based on a decision-making process stored in a dictionary named `decisions`. It returns a list of CSS style strings for each element in the row if a corresponding entry exists in the `decisions` dictionary and is truthy; otherwise, it returns an empty string for each element.

**parameters**:
· row: A data structure (likely a list or similar iterable) representing a single row of data. Each element in this row will be styled according to the function's logic.
· decisions: An external dictionary that maps names (presumably corresponding to row identifiers) to boolean values indicating whether a particular styling should be applied.

**Code Description**: The function `style_rows` checks if there is an entry for the current row's name in the `decisions` dictionary and if this entry evaluates to True. If both conditions are met, it returns a list of CSS style strings, each setting the color to green, with the length of this list matching the number of elements in the input row. This effectively styles all elements in the row green. If there is no such entry or the value is falsy, it returns a list of empty strings of the same length as the row, indicating that no specific styling should be applied.

**Note**: The function assumes the existence and proper structure of the `decisions` dictionary outside its scope. Developers must ensure that this dictionary is correctly populated with appropriate keys and boolean values before calling `style_rows`.

**Output Example**: If `row = ['data1', 'data2']` and `decisions[row.name]` evaluates to True, then `style_rows(row)` would return `['color: green;', 'color: green;']`. Conversely, if `decisions[row.name]` is False or does not exist, the function would return `['', '']`.
***
### FunctionDef style_columns(col)
**style_columns**: This function styles DataFrame columns based on their names. It applies different CSS styles to cells within a column depending on whether the column name matches a specific hypothesis name defined in a dictionary.

parameters:
· col: A pandas Series object representing a single column of a DataFrame.
· name_dict: An external dictionary expected to contain key-value pairs where the key is "hypothesis" and the value is the name of the hypothesis column. This dictionary is used to identify which column should be styled differently.

Code Description: The function first checks if the name of the column (col.name) does not match the value associated with the key "hypothesis" in the external dictionary name_dict. If it doesn't match, it returns a list where each element is the string "font-style: italic;", indicating that all cells in this column should be displayed in italics. If the column name matches the hypothesis name, it returns a list with elements as "font-weight: bold;", meaning all cells in this column will be displayed in bold.

Note: The function assumes the existence of an external dictionary named name_dict which must contain the key "hypothesis" to avoid KeyError exceptions. Developers should ensure that this dictionary is properly defined and passed to the function's context before calling it.

Output Example: If the DataFrame has a column named 'hypothesis' and another named 'data', and name_dict = {"hypothesis": "hypothesis"}, then calling style_columns on the 'hypothesis' column would return ['font-weight: bold;', ..., 'font-weight: bold;'] for all rows, while calling it on the 'data' column would return ['font-style: italic;', ..., 'font-style: italic;'].
***
## FunctionDef metrics_window(df, R, C)
**metrics_window**: This function generates a multi-subplot interactive chart using Plotly to visualize metrics from a DataFrame. Each subplot represents a column of the DataFrame, displaying data points as lines and markers with custom hover text that includes hypothesis information.

**parameters**:
· df: A pandas DataFrame containing the metric data where each row corresponds to a different observation (e.g., loop round) and each column represents a different metric.
· R: An integer specifying the number of rows in the subplot grid.
· C: An integer specifying the number of columns in the subplot grid.
· height: An optional integer parameter that sets the height of the chart. The default value is 300 pixels.
· colors: An optional list of strings representing color codes for each trace (subplot). If not provided, a default color will be used.

**Code Description**: 
The function starts by creating a subplot grid using Plotly's `make_subplots` method with the specified number of rows and columns. It also sets the titles of each subplot to match the column names of the DataFrame.

A nested function, `hypothesis_hover_text`, is defined within `metrics_window`. This helper function formats hover text for data points based on hypothesis information stored in a global state object (`state`). The hover text includes the hypothesis statement and its decision status (successful or not), styled with HTML tags to change color and line wrapping.

The main part of the function constructs a list of hover texts for each data point, excluding a specific index ("alpha158"). If baseline metrics are available in `state.alpha158_metrics`, they are prepended to the hover text list. 

For each column in the DataFrame, the function calculates its position within the subplot grid and adds a scatter plot trace to the figure using Plotly's `go.Scatter` method. The trace includes the data points from the DataFrame, custom marker sizes and colors (if provided), and the previously constructed hover texts.

The layout of the chart is updated to remove the legend and set the specified height. If baseline metrics are present, the x-axis labels for all subplots are customized to highlight the baseline index ("alpha158") in blue and bold.

Finally, the function renders the Plotly figure using Streamlit's `st.plotly_chart` method, making it visible in a web application.

**Note**: This function assumes the existence of a global state object (`state`) that contains necessary information about hypotheses and decisions. It is designed to be called within a Streamlit application context.

**Output Example**: The output would be an interactive chart with multiple subplots arranged in a grid pattern, each displaying a different metric from the DataFrame. Each data point on the plots has custom hover text showing hypothesis details. The chart height can be adjusted using the `height` parameter, and colors for each subplot can be customized via the `colors` list. If baseline metrics are available, they will be highlighted in the x-axis labels of all subplots.
### FunctionDef hypothesis_hover_text(h, d)
**hypothesis_hover_text**: This function generates HTML-formatted hover text for a hypothesis, which can be used in user interfaces to display detailed information about hypotheses in a visually appealing manner.

parameters:
· h: An instance of the Hypothesis class, containing the hypothesis text that needs to be formatted.
· d: A boolean flag indicating whether the hypothesis should be highlighted (True) or not (False). Defaults to False.

Code Description: The function takes two parameters. It first determines the color for the text based on the value of the 'd' parameter. If 'd' is True, the text will be colored green; otherwise, it will be black. The hypothesis text from the Hypothesis object 'h' is then wrapped into lines with a maximum width of 60 characters using the `textwrap.wrap` function to ensure that the text does not exceed the specified width in the UI. These lines are joined together with HTML line break tags ('<br>') and enclosed within a span tag styled with the previously determined color. The resulting string is an HTML snippet that can be used directly in web applications or similar interfaces.

Note: This function is particularly useful for creating interactive user interfaces where hypotheses need to be displayed with varying emphasis based on their status or importance, indicated by the 'd' parameter.

Output Example: If the Hypothesis object 'h' contains the text "This is a long hypothesis that needs to be wrapped into multiple lines because it exceeds the maximum width specified for display in the user interface", and if 'd' is True, the function will return:
<span style='color: green;'>This is a long hypothesis that needs<br>to be wrapped into multiple lines<br>because it exceeds the maximum width<br>specified for display in the user interface</span>

If 'd' were False instead, the color would change to black.
***
## FunctionDef summary_window
**summary_window**: This function creates a user interface using Streamlit to display a summary of metrics and hypotheses based on the current scenario state. It handles two types of scenarios: `SIMILAR_SCENARIOS` and `GeneralModelScenario`, each with its specific layout and data presentation.

**parameters**:
· No explicit parameters are defined for this function. Instead, it relies on global variables and objects such as `state.scenario`, `state.lround`, `state.hypotheses`, `state.h_decisions`, `state.alpha158_metrics`, and `state.metric_series`.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking the type of scenario stored in `state.scenario`. If it is an instance of `SIMILAR_SCENARIOS`:
- It displays a header titled "Summary📊" with a rainbow divider.
- If `state.lround` is 0, the function returns immediately without further processing.
- Inside a container, it sets up two columns: one for displaying metrics and another for a toggle to show only successful hypotheses.
- Depending on whether the scenario is an instance of `QlibFactorScenario` and if `state.alpha158_metrics` is available, it constructs a DataFrame from either `state.metric_series` alone or including `state.alpha158_metrics`.
- It filters this DataFrame based on the toggle state (`show_true_only`) to show only successful hypotheses if selected.
- If the filtered DataFrame has one row, it displays the data as a table. Otherwise, it plots the metrics using Plotly charts:
  - For single-column DataFrames, it creates a line chart with markers.
  - For multi-column DataFrames, it calls `metrics_window` to generate a multi-subplot interactive chart.

If the scenario is an instance of `GeneralModelScenario`:
- It displays a subheader titled "Summary📊" with a rainbow divider.
- If there are evolving code messages in `state.msgs[state.lround]["d.evolving code"]`, it processes these messages to create tabs for each task.
- Each tab includes expanding sections for the evolving code and feedback, using Streamlit's expander functionality.
- The feedback is displayed by calling `evolving_feedback_window` with the appropriate content.

**Note**: This function is designed to be called within a Streamlit application context where the necessary state objects are available. It assumes that the required libraries (`st`, `pd`, `px`) have been imported and initialized. The function provides a clear and organized way to present metrics and hypotheses, adapting its layout based on the scenario type.

**Output Example**: Depending on the scenario type:
- For `SIMILAR_SCENARIOS`: A header titled "Summary📊", toggle for successful hypotheses, and either a table or an interactive chart displaying metrics.
- For `GeneralModelScenario`: A subheader titled "Summary📊" with tabs for each task, each containing evolving code and feedback sections.
## FunctionDef tabs_hint
**tabs_hint**: This function displays a hint to users on how to navigate through tabs within an application interface using either arrow keys (⬅️ ➡️) or by holding Shift and scrolling with the mouse wheel 🖱️.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `tabs_hint` function utilizes Streamlit's `markdown` method to render a small, gray-colored paragraph at the bottom of the interface. This paragraph provides users with instructions on how to navigate through multiple tabs efficiently. The text is styled using HTML within the markdown call, specifying a smaller font size and a light gray color for better readability against other content.

Note: Usage points include calling this function whenever there are multiple tabs in an application window and the total length of tab names exceeds 100 characters. This ensures that users are aware of alternative navigation methods when dealing with numerous or long-named tabs, enhancing user experience by providing easy-to-follow instructions directly within the interface.
## FunctionDef tasks_window(tasks)
**tasks_window**: This function displays a window containing details of either Factor Tasks or Model Tasks using Streamlit's tab interface. It accepts a list of tasks, which can be instances of either `FactorTask` or `ModelTask`, and renders each task's details within its own tab.

parameters:
· tasks: A list of objects where each object is an instance of either `FactorTask` or `ModelTask`. This parameter contains the data to be displayed in the tabs.

Code Description: The function begins by checking the type of the first element in the `tasks` list to determine whether it should handle Factor Tasks or Model Tasks. If the first task is a `FactorTask`, it sets up a tab for each task, displaying the factor name, description, formulation, and variables with their descriptions. Similarly, if the first task is a `ModelTask`, it sets up tabs for each model task, showing the model's name, type, description, formulation, and variables.

The function also includes a mechanism to display navigation hints using the `tabs_hint` function when the total length of all tab names exceeds 100 characters. This helps users navigate through multiple tabs efficiently by providing instructions on how to use arrow keys or mouse wheel scrolling with Shift held down.

Note: Usage points include calling this function within an application where detailed information about Factor Tasks or Model Tasks needs to be presented in a structured and user-friendly manner, such as in research interfaces or model management systems. This ensures that users can easily access and understand the details of each task or model through intuitive tabbed navigation.
## FunctionDef research_window
**research_window**: This function creates a research window using Streamlit to display different types of content based on the scenario type. It handles two main scenarios: SIMILAR_SCENARIOS and GeneralModelScenario, displaying relevant information such as PDF images, hypotheses, experiments, and model details.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters are defined for this function. However, it relies on external state variables (`state.scenario`, `state.msgs`, and `round`) to fetch and display data.

Code Description: The function starts by creating a container with a border using Streamlit's `st.container()` method. It sets the title based on whether the scenario is an instance of SIMILAR_SCENARIOS or GeneralModelScenario, appending "(reader)" to the title in the latter case.

For scenarios that are instances of SIMILAR_SCENARIOS:
- The function checks if there are any PDF images available under the key `"r.extract_factors_and_implement.load_pdf_screenshot"` in `state.msgs[round]`. If found, it displays up to two images using `st.image()`.
- It then looks for a hypothesis generated under the key `"r.hypothesis generation"`. If present, it extracts the hypothesis and its reason from the first message content and displays them.
- For experiments, it checks the key `"r.experiment generation"` in `state.msgs[round]`. If an experiment is found, it calls the `tasks_window` function to display details of the experiment.

For scenarios that are instances of GeneralModelScenario:
- The function divides the container into two columns using `st.columns()`.
- In the first column (c1), it checks for PDF images under the key `"r.pdf_image"` and displays them similarly as in SIMILAR_SCENARIOS.
- In the second column (c2), it looks for loaded experiments either under the keys `"d.load_experiment"` or `"r.load_experiment"`. If found, it extracts the sub-tasks from the experiment's content and calls `tasks_window` to display these tasks.

Note: This function is designed to be part of a larger application that manages different types of research scenarios. It relies on the state object to maintain context across various parts of the application, ensuring that the correct data is displayed based on the current scenario type. Developers should ensure that the `state`, `msgs`, and `round` variables are properly initialized and updated throughout the application's lifecycle to avoid errors or unexpected behavior in the research window. Beginners should familiarize themselves with Streamlit's container and column functionalities, as well as how state management works within the context of this application.
## FunctionDef feedback_window
**feedback_window**: This function generates a feedback window within a Streamlit application to display various types of feedback related to a scenario, including configuration settings, quantitative backtesting charts, hypothesis evaluations, and more. It is designed to provide detailed insights based on the current state of an experiment.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The function relies on global variables or objects such as `state`, which should be defined elsewhere in the application.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function starts by checking if the current scenario stored in `state.scenario` is an instance of a predefined set of scenarios (`SIMILAR_SCENARIOS`). If true, it proceeds to create a container with a border using Streamlit's `st.container()` method. Inside this container, a subheader titled "Feedback📝" is displayed with an orange divider and an anchor for easy navigation.

If the current round number (`state.lround`) is greater than 0 and the scenario is one of several specific types (QlibModelScenario, QlibFactorScenario, QlibFactorFromReportScenario, or KGScenario), it displays an expander titled "Config⚙️" that contains the experiment settings in markdown format. The expander is set to be expanded by default.

The function then checks if there are any quantitative backtesting charts available for the current round (`state.msgs[round]["ef.Quantitative Backtesting Chart"]`). If such data exists, it displays a markdown header "Returns📈" and plots the chart using Plotly through Streamlit's `st.plotly_chart()` method.

Next, it checks for hypothesis feedback data (`state.msgs[round]["ef.feedback"]`). If available, it extracts this data and displays it in a structured format with markdown, detailing observations, hypothesis evaluation, new hypotheses, decisions, and reasons behind these decisions.

For scenarios of type `KGScenario`, the function looks for runner results (`state.msgs[round]["ef.runner result"]`). If found, it constructs an absolute path to a submission CSV file. It then displays this path in green markdown text and provides a download button for users to download the submission.csv file directly from the Streamlit interface. In case of any exceptions during the file reading or downloading process, it catches these exceptions and displays an error message in red markdown text.

Note: Usage points.
This function is intended to be called within a Streamlit application where `state` holds the necessary information about the current scenario, round number, messages, and other relevant data. Developers should ensure that all required modules (like Streamlit) are imported and that the global `state` object is properly initialized before calling this function. Beginners should familiarize themselves with Streamlit's components such as containers, expanders, markdown, plotly charts, and download buttons to understand how these elements contribute to building interactive web applications.
## FunctionDef evolving_window
**evolving_window**: This function creates a user interface using Streamlit to display evolving development status and feedback related to coding scenarios. It dynamically adjusts its content based on whether the scenario is part of predefined similar scenarios or involves an evolving coder.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly; it relies on global state variables such as `state.scenario`, `state.erounds`, `state.e_decisions`, and `state.msgs`.

Code Description: The function begins by setting the title of a subheader based on whether the current scenario is part of predefined similar scenarios. If it is, the title is "Development🛠️"; otherwise, it includes an additional note indicating evolving coder status.

The function then checks if there are any evolving rounds recorded in `state.erounds[round]`. If so, it displays an evolving status section using markdown to create a table that visually represents the status of each evolving round. Each cell in the table can contain symbols (🕙 for pending, ✔️ for success, ❌ for failure) based on the values stored in `state.e_decisions`.

Following the evolving status, if there are multiple evolving rounds, the function provides a radio button interface to select which specific evolving round to view. If only one evolving round exists, it defaults to that round.

The function then retrieves workspaces (`ws`) associated with the selected evolving round from `state.msgs[round]["d.evolving code"]`. It generates tab names for these workspaces based on their target task names and appends a checkmark or cross symbol depending on whether the final decision in the feedback is positive or negative.

If the total length of all tab names exceeds 100 characters, it calls `tabs_hint` to provide users with instructions on how to navigate through tabs efficiently. It then creates these tabs using Streamlit's `st.tabs` function and populates each tab with details about the workspace path and code snippets from `w.code_dict`. For each workspace, it also calls `evolving_feedback_window` to display feedback related to that workspace.

Note: This function is designed to be called within a Streamlit application context where the necessary state variables are properly initialized. It assumes that the required Streamlit library (`st`) has been imported and initialized. The function is particularly useful for scenarios involving evolving development processes, providing a clear and organized way to present status and feedback to users.
## FunctionDef show_times(round)
**show_times**: This function displays the time differences associated with various keys in a specific round from a state object. It calculates the difference between the first and last timestamps for each key, formats this duration into minutes and seconds, and then outputs it using a markdown format.

parameters:
· round: An integer representing the index of the round for which the times are to be displayed.

Code Description: The function iterates over items in `state.times[round]`, where `state` is presumably an object or dictionary containing time data organized by rounds. For each key-value pair, it checks if there is more than one timestamp (`v`). If so, it calculates the difference between the last and first timestamps to find the duration. If there's only one timestamp, the difference is set to zero (since `v[0] - v[0]` equals zero). The total seconds of this difference are then calculated and broken down into minutes and seconds. Finally, the function uses `st.markdown()` to display each key along with its corresponding duration in a formatted string that includes blue text for the key, red text for the minutes, and orange text for the seconds.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that `state.times` is properly initialized and contains data structured as expected (i.e., a dictionary of lists of timestamps indexed by rounds). Additionally, this function assumes the existence of an object or module named `st` with a `markdown()` method, which is likely part of a library such as Streamlit used for creating web applications.
