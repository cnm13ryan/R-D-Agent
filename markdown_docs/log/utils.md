## ClassDef LogColors
**LogColors**: A class containing ANSI color codes for use in console output to enhance readability and visual appeal of log messages.

attributes:
· RED: ANSI code for red text.
· GREEN: ANSI code for green text.
· YELLOW: ANSI code for yellow text.
· BLUE: ANSI code for blue text.
· MAGENTA: ANSI code for magenta text.
· CYAN: ANSI code for cyan text.
· WHITE: ANSI code for white text.
· GRAY: ANSI code for gray text.
· BLACK: ANSI code for black text.
· BOLD: ANSI code to make text bold.
· ITALIC: ANSI code to italicize text.
· END: ANSI code to reset all formatting.

Code Description: The LogColors class provides a set of predefined ANSI escape sequences as class attributes, which can be used to format console output. These codes allow for coloring and styling text in terminal applications. The class includes methods to retrieve all color codes and to render text with specified colors and styles. Additionally, there is a static method to remove ANSI formatting from strings.

The `get_all_colors` class method returns a list of all the color and style attributes defined in the LogColors class, excluding any special methods or callable attributes. This can be useful for dynamically accessing available formatting options.

The `render` instance method formats a given text string with specified color and style. It checks if the provided color and style are valid by comparing them against the list of all colors obtained from `get_all_colors`. If either is invalid, it raises a ValueError. The method then applies the color and style to the text and resets formatting at the end.

The `remove_ansi_codes` static method removes ANSI escape sequences from a string, effectively stripping any color or style formatting. This can be useful when preparing log messages for storage or display in environments that do not support ANSI codes, such as file logs.

Note: The `render` method's implementation has an issue where it checks if the provided color and style are in the list of all colors, which includes both colors and styles. This check will always fail because the list contains strings like 'RED', 'GREEN', etc., not their corresponding ANSI codes. It is recommended to separate the validation logic for colors and styles.

Output Example: 
When using `LogColors.render("Hello World", LogColors.GREEN, LogColors.BOLD)`, the output in a terminal that supports ANSI codes would be "Hello World" displayed in bold green text. If printed to a file or an environment that does not support ANSI codes, it would appear as "\033[92m\033[1mHello World\033[0m", which includes the raw ANSI escape sequences. Using `LogColors.remove_ansi_codes` on this string would result in "Hello World" without any formatting.
### FunctionDef get_all_colors(cls)
**get_all_colors**: This function retrieves a list of color attributes defined within the `LogColors` class. It filters out any special methods (those starting with double underscores) and callable attributes, ensuring that only static color definitions are included.

**parameters**:
· cls: A reference to the `LogColors` class itself. This parameter is used in the context of a class method, allowing access to class-level attributes without needing an instance.

**Code Description**: The function begins by calling `dir(cls)` to obtain a list of all attributes and methods associated with the `LogColors` class. It then filters this list using a list comprehension, excluding any names that start with double underscores (which typically denote special or private methods) and those that are callable (methods). This ensures that only static color definitions remain in the list. Finally, it uses another list comprehension to retrieve the actual values of these attributes from the class, returning them as a list.

**Note**: This function is designed to be used within the context of a class method, indicated by the `cls` parameter. It is particularly useful for dynamically accessing all color definitions available in the `LogColors` class, which can then be utilized elsewhere in the codebase, such as in validation checks or rendering functions.

**Output Example**: Assuming the `LogColors` class defines several colors like `RED`, `GREEN`, and `BLUE`, a possible output of this function would be:
['RED', 'GREEN', 'BLUE']

### FunctionDef render(self, text, color, style)
**render**: This function renders a given text string by applying specified color and style attributes. It ensures that the input color and style values are valid by checking them against a predefined list of colors obtained from the `LogColors` class.

parameters:
· text: The string to be rendered with color and style.
· color: An optional parameter specifying the color to apply to the text. If provided, it must match one of the color definitions in the `LogColors` class.
· style: An optional parameter specifying the style to apply to the text. If provided, it must match one of the style definitions in the `LogColors` class.

Code Description: The function starts by retrieving all valid color and style options from the `LogColors` class using the `get_all_colors` method. It then checks if the provided `color` or `style` parameters are present in this list. If either parameter is invalid, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate error message.

The function constructs the final rendered text by wrapping the input `text` with the specified `color` and `style`. The `self.END` attribute is used to reset any formatting applied after the text, ensuring that subsequent text remains unaffected. However, there is a logical error in the code: it raises an exception if the color or style is found in the list of colors, which should be reversed to only raise an exception when they are not found.

Note: It is important to ensure that the input `text` has not already been rendered with other styles or colors before calling this function. Additionally, developers should be aware of the logical error in the code where it checks for the presence of color and style incorrectly.

Output Example: Assuming the `LogColors` class defines `RED` as a color and `BOLD` as a style, calling `render("Hello World", "RED", "BOLD")` would return a string that applies both the red color and bold style to "Hello World". However, due to the logical error in the code, this function will raise an exception if `color` or `style` is valid. The correct output should be something like "\033[1m\033[31mHello World\033[0m" where `\033[1m` represents bold style, `\033[31m` represents red color, and `\033[0m` resets the formatting.

### FunctionDef remove_ansi_codes(s)
**remove_ansi_codes**: This function is designed to strip ANSI escape codes from a given string. ANSI escape codes are often used to add color and formatting to text in terminal outputs, but they can be problematic when processing or storing plain text.

parameters:
· s: A string that may contain ANSI escape codes which the function aims to remove.

Code Description: The function utilizes a regular expression to identify and remove all sequences of characters that match the pattern of ANSI escape codes. These codes typically start with the ASCII escape character (ESC, represented as \x1B in hexadecimal) followed by a sequence of numbers and letters enclosed in square brackets. This pattern is used to match various formatting commands such as setting text color, background color, or other styles.

The regular expression `r"\x1B\[[0-?]*[ -/]*[@-~]"` is compiled into a regex object named `ansi_escape`. The `sub` method of this object is then called with an empty string and the input string `s`, effectively replacing all occurrences of ANSI escape codes in `s` with nothing, thus removing them.

Note: This function is particularly useful when you need to process or store log messages that may contain colored text but require plain text for further operations. It is used in the `file_format` method of the `RDAgentLog` class within the `log/logger.py` module to clean up log messages before formatting them for file storage.

Output Example: If the input string is "\x1B[31mThis is a red message\x1B[0m", the function will return "This is a red message" by removing the ANSI escape codes that change text color.

## ClassDef CallerInfo
**CallerInfo**: A dictionary type designed to encapsulate information about a caller function within a Python program. This includes details such as the function name, line number where the call was made, and optionally, the module name.

attributes:
· function: A string representing the name of the function that called another function.
· line: An integer indicating the line number in the source file from which the call was initiated.
· name: An optional string providing the name of the module from which the call originated.

Code Description: CallerInfo is defined as a TypedDict, which is a dictionary with specific key types. This class serves to standardize the structure and expected data types for caller information across different parts of an application. The keys in this dictionary are 'function', 'line', and 'name'. The 'function' key holds the name of the function that made the call, while 'line' specifies the line number in the source code where the call was executed. The 'name' key is optional and typically contains the module's name from which the call was made.

Note: This class is particularly useful for logging and debugging purposes, allowing developers to track down the origin of function calls within a complex application. It is often used alongside functions like get_caller_info, which retrieves this information dynamically at runtime by inspecting the current stack frame.
## FunctionDef get_caller_info
**get_caller_info**: Retrieves information about the caller function within a Python program, including details such as the module name, line number, and function name from which the call was made.

parameters:
· None: This function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `get_caller_info` function utilizes Python's built-in `inspect.stack()` method to obtain information about the current stack frame. It accesses the third element of the returned list (index 2), as this typically contains the caller's stack frame information. From this, it extracts the line number and the module name by accessing the global variables of the frame. The function name is retrieved from the code object associated with the frame. This information is then organized into a dictionary that conforms to the `CallerInfo` type, which includes keys for the function name, line number, and module name.

Note: This function is particularly useful in logging and debugging scenarios where it is necessary to track down the origin of function calls within an application. It provides a standardized way to gather caller information dynamically at runtime.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "line": 42,
    "name": "my_module",
    "function": "some_function"
}
