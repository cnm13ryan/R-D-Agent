## ClassDef Message
**Message**: The info unit of the storage

attributes:
· tag: A string representing a namespace, formatted like a.b.c.
· level: A string indicating the logging level, which can be one of "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", or "CRITICAL".
· timestamp: A datetime object denoting when the message was generated.
· caller: An optional string specifying the caller of the logging, formatted as `file:func:line`.
· pid_trace: An optional string representing a process ID trace; for example, A-B-C indicates that process A created B, and B created C.
· content: The content of the log message, which can be any object.

Code Description: The Message class serves as a fundamental unit for storing logging information within the system. It encapsulates various attributes essential for tracking and categorizing log messages. The `tag` attribute provides a hierarchical namespace to organize logs, while the `level` attribute specifies the severity of the message. The `timestamp` records when the message was created, aiding in temporal analysis. The `caller` attribute helps trace where in the codebase the logging call originated from, which is useful for debugging and monitoring. The `pid_trace` provides a lineage of process IDs, indicating the sequence of processes that led to the log entry. Lastly, the `content` holds the actual message or data being logged.

Note: Developers should ensure that all messages are appropriately tagged and leveled to maintain clarity and utility in log analysis. Beginners might find it helpful to start by logging basic information with a level of "INFO" and gradually incorporate more detailed logs as needed for debugging purposes.
## ClassDef Storage
**Storage**: Basic storage to support saving objects; designed to cater to both logging ends (direct usage with native logging storage or integration with other logging tools) and view ends (primarily for subclasses of `logging.base.View`).

attributes:
· log: Method to save an object, returning the storage identifier.
· iter_msg: Generator method to iterate over messages stored.

Code Description: The `Storage` class is an abstract base class that defines two essential methods: `log` and `iter_msg`. The `log` method is intended for saving objects with specified parameters such as the object itself (`obj`), its name (`name`), the type of save format (`save_type`), and optionally a timestamp (`timestamp`). It returns either a string or a path representing the storage identifier of the saved object. This method supports different serialization formats including JSON, text, and pickle.

The `iter_msg` method is a generator that yields messages stored in the system. It accepts a boolean parameter `watch`, which determines whether to continuously monitor for new content and yield it as well. This method is crucial for subclasses of `logging.base.View` that need to retrieve or display logged information.

Note: The `Storage` class itself does not provide concrete implementations for its methods, making it an abstract base class meant to be subclassed by specific storage solutions like `FileStorage`. Developers can extend this class to implement custom storage mechanisms tailored to their application's needs. For example, the `FileStorage` class implements file-based logging, saving objects in JSON, text, or pickle formats and providing methods to iterate over logged messages and truncate logs based on a specified timestamp.
### FunctionDef log(self, obj, name, save_type, timestamp)
**log**: This function facilitates logging an object to a storage system with specified parameters such as name, save type, and timestamp. It returns a storage identifier which can be either a string or a Path object.

parameters:
· obj: The object that needs to be logged. This can be any Python object.
· name: A string representing the name of the object. This is useful when logging multiple objects under the same name for organization purposes. For example, "a.b.c".
· save_type: Specifies the format in which the object should be saved. It accepts three literal values: "json", "text", or "pkl". The default value is "text".
· timestamp: An optional datetime object that can be provided to specify a particular time for logging. If not provided, the current time might be used by the underlying storage mechanism.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to customize the logging process further.

Code Description: The function `log` is designed to handle the logging of various objects into a storage system with flexibility in how these objects are named and formatted. It supports different serialization formats (json, text, pkl) for storing the object data, allowing developers to choose based on their needs. The inclusion of an optional timestamp parameter provides control over when the log entry is recorded, which can be crucial for debugging or tracking changes over time. The function returns a storage identifier that indicates where the logged object is stored, aiding in retrieval and management.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the correct save_type is chosen based on how the data will be used later (e.g., json for structured data interchange, pkl for Python-specific serialization). Providing a meaningful name can help in organizing logs effectively. The use of **kwargs allows for future extensibility, enabling additional parameters to be passed without modifying the function signature.

### FunctionDef iter_msg(self, watch)
**iter_msg**: This function provides an iterator over messages stored in a log storage system. It allows users to access each message sequentially, optionally watching for new content as it is added.

parameters:
· watch: A boolean flag indicating whether the iterator should continue to yield newly added messages after reaching the end of the current list of messages. If set to True, the function will wait and yield any new messages that are appended to the storage.

Code Description: The `iter_msg` function is designed to facilitate the retrieval of log messages from a storage system in an iterative manner. By using this function, developers can process each message one at a time without loading all messages into memory simultaneously. This is particularly useful for handling large volumes of log data efficiently.

The function accepts a single parameter, `watch`, which determines whether the iteration should be static (i.e., over the existing set of messages) or dynamic (continuously yielding new messages as they are added). When `watch` is set to True, the iterator will not terminate after reaching the last message in the current storage. Instead, it will wait for additional messages and yield them as soon as they become available.

This functionality is beneficial in scenarios where real-time log monitoring is required, such as during system debugging or performance analysis. By setting `watch` to True, developers can continuously monitor log output without restarting their monitoring process.

Note: Developers should be aware that when using the `iter_msg` function with `watch=True`, the iterator will not terminate naturally and may require external logic to stop the iteration at an appropriate time. Beginners are encouraged to start by iterating over messages without watching for new content (i.e., `watch=False`) to understand how log data is structured and processed before implementing real-time monitoring features.

## ClassDef View
**View**: This class serves as an abstract base for displaying content stored within a Storage object. It provides a template method `display` which must be implemented by any subclass to define how the storage's contents should be presented.

attributes:
· s: An instance of the Storage class, representing the data source from which content is retrieved and displayed.
· watch: A boolean flag indicating whether the display mechanism should continuously monitor for new content in the Storage object and update the display accordingly.

Code Description: The View class is designed to encapsulate the logic required to present data stored in a Storage object. It includes an abstract method `display`, which subclasses must implement to provide specific functionality tailored to their needs. This design pattern allows for flexibility, enabling different types of views (e.g., console output, graphical user interface) to be implemented without altering the core storage mechanism.

The `display` method takes two parameters: a Storage object and an optional boolean flag named 'watch'. The Storage object is expected to contain the data that needs to be displayed. The 'watch' parameter allows for real-time updates if set to True, meaning any new content added to the Storage object after the initial display call will also be shown.

Note: Usage points include creating subclasses of View and implementing the `display` method to suit specific requirements. Developers should ensure that their implementations respect the intended functionality of continuously updating the display when 'watch' is True. This abstract class serves as a foundation for building various user interfaces or output mechanisms in applications that require data visualization from a Storage object.
### FunctionDef display(self, s, watch)
**display**: The `display` function is designed to handle the visualization of content stored within a `Storage` object. It can optionally monitor for new content and display it as it becomes available.

parameters:
· s: An instance of the `Storage` class, which serves as the repository for objects that need to be logged or viewed.
· watch: A boolean flag indicating whether the function should continuously monitor the storage for new content and display it in real-time. By default, this parameter is set to `False`.

Code Description: The `display` function takes a `Storage` object as its primary argument and an optional boolean parameter `watch`. The purpose of this function is to facilitate the viewing or displaying of stored data. If the `watch` parameter is set to `True`, the function will not only display the current content but also keep track of any new entries added to the storage, updating the display accordingly.

The function leverages the `iter_msg` method from the `Storage` class, which is a generator that yields messages stored in the system. When `watch` is set to `True`, this method will continuously monitor for new content and yield it as well, allowing the `display` function to update its output dynamically.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to visualize logged data either once or in real-time as more data becomes available. This function is particularly useful for subclasses of `logging.base.View` that are responsible for displaying stored information in a user-friendly manner. Developers can customize the behavior of this function by implementing specific storage solutions that inherit from the abstract `Storage` class, ensuring compatibility with various logging mechanisms and formats.
