## FunctionDef load_documents_by_langchain(path)
**load_documents_by_langchain**: This function loads documents from a specified path using LangChain's document loading utilities. It supports both directories containing multiple PDF files and individual PDF files.

parameters:
· path: A string representing the path to the directory or file containing the documents. The path can point to either a single PDF file or a folder with multiple PDFs.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the provided path is a directory using `Path(path).is_dir()`. If it is a directory, it initializes a `PyPDFDirectoryLoader` object, which is designed to load all PDF files from that directory. The `silent_errors=True` parameter ensures that any errors encountered during loading are suppressed silently, allowing the function to continue processing other documents in the directory.

If the path does not point to a directory (implying it points to a single file), the function initializes a `PyPDFLoader` object for that specific PDF file. After setting up the appropriate loader based on the path type, the function calls the `load()` method of the loader object to load the documents and returns the result as a list.

Note: This function is typically used in scenarios where multiple PDFs need to be loaded from a directory or a single PDF needs to be processed. The returned list of documents can then be further manipulated or analyzed, such as by extracting text content or metadata.

Output Example: A possible return value of this function could be a list of document objects, each representing a loaded PDF file. For instance:
[
    Document(page_content="Content of the first page", metadata={'source': 'path/to/file1.pdf'}),
    Document(page_content="Content of the second page", metadata={'source': 'path/to/file1.pdf'}),
    Document(page_content="Content of the first page", metadata={'source': 'path/to/file2.pdf'})
]
Each `Document` object in the list contains the text content of a page and associated metadata, such as the source file path.
## FunctionDef process_documents_by_langchain(docs)
**process_documents_by_langchain**: This function processes a list of document objects, grouping them by their names and concatenating their contents if multiple documents share the same name.

parameters:
· docs: A list of Document objects that need to be processed. Each Document object should have metadata containing a "source" key indicating the document's source path or identifier, and a page_content attribute holding the text content of the document.

Code Description: The function initializes an empty dictionary named `content_dict` to store the concatenated contents of documents grouped by their names. It iterates over each document in the provided list. For each document, it checks if the file exists at the path specified in the document's metadata under the "source" key. If the file exists, it resolves and converts the path to a string; otherwise, it uses the source value directly as the document name. The function then retrieves the content of the document from its `page_content` attribute. It checks if the document name already exists in the dictionary. If not, it adds the document name as a key with its content as the value. If the document name is already present, it appends the current document's content to the existing value associated with that document name. After processing all documents, the function returns the `content_dict` containing the grouped and concatenated contents of the documents.

Note: This function assumes that each Document object has a metadata dictionary with at least a "source" key and a page_content attribute. The function is typically used in scenarios where multiple documents might have the same name or identifier, and their contents need to be combined into a single entry per document name.

Output Example: 
{
    '/path/to/document1.txt': 'This is the content of document 1.',
    '/path/to/document2.txt': 'This is the first part of document 2.\nThis is the second part of document 2.'
}
## FunctionDef load_and_process_pdfs_by_langchain(path)
**load_and_process_pdfs_by_langchain**: This function loads PDF documents from a specified path using LangChain's utilities and processes them to group and concatenate their contents by document name.

parameters:
· path: A string representing the path to the directory or file containing the PDF documents. The path can point to either a single PDF file or a folder with multiple PDFs.

Code Description: The function `load_and_process_pdfs_by_langchain` is designed to streamline the process of handling PDF documents by combining two key operations into one step. It first calls `load_documents_by_langchain`, which loads all PDF files from the specified path, whether it points to a single file or multiple files within a directory. This loading function uses LangChain's document loading utilities, specifically `PyPDFLoader` for individual files and `PyPDFDirectoryLoader` for directories.

After successfully loading the documents into a list of Document objects, `load_and_process_pdfs_by_langchain` then passes this list to `process_documents_by_langchain`. This processing function groups the documents by their names (derived from the source path in each document's metadata) and concatenates the text content of any documents that share the same name. The result is a dictionary where each key corresponds to a unique document name, and each value is the concatenated text content of all pages from documents with that name.

Note: This function is particularly useful for scenarios involving multiple PDFs that may have the same identifier or need to be combined into a single entry per document name. It simplifies the workflow by encapsulating both loading and processing steps within a single function call, making it easier for developers to integrate into their applications.

Output Example:
{
    '/path/to/document1.pdf': 'This is the content of the first page.\nThis is the content of the second page.',
    '/path/to/document2.pdf': 'Content of document 2.'
}
In this example, two PDF documents are loaded and processed. The first document has multiple pages, and their contents are concatenated into a single string under its path as the key in the dictionary. The second document is a single-page document, so its content appears directly as the value associated with its path.
## FunctionDef load_and_process_one_pdf_by_azure_document_intelligence(path, key, endpoint)
**load_and_process_one_pdf_by_azure_document_intelligence**: This function processes a single PDF file using Azure Document Intelligence to extract its content.

parameters:
· path: A Path object representing the location of the PDF file to be processed.
· key: A string containing the API key for accessing Azure Document Intelligence services.
· endpoint: A string specifying the endpoint URL for the Azure Document Intelligence service.

Code Description: The function begins by determining the number of pages in the specified PDF using PyPDFLoader. It then initializes a DocumentAnalysisClient with the provided endpoint and API key credentials. The PDF file is opened in binary read mode, and the client's begin_analyze_document method is called to analyze the document using the prebuilt-document model, specifying the range of pages to process. After analysis, the function returns the content extracted from the document.

Note: This function requires that the Azure Document Intelligence service is properly set up with a valid API key and endpoint URL. The path parameter must point to a valid PDF file.

Output Example: "This is the first page of the document. It contains an introduction to the topic discussed in this report. The following pages delve deeper into the subject matter, providing detailed analysis and conclusions."

The function is designed to be used as part of a larger system that processes multiple documents, as demonstrated by its usage within load_and_process_pdfs_by_azure_document_intelligence, which handles both individual PDF files and directories containing multiple PDFs.
## FunctionDef load_and_process_pdfs_by_azure_document_intelligence(path)
**load_and_process_pdfs_by_azure_document_intelligence**: This function processes PDF files using Azure Document Intelligence to extract their content. It supports both individual PDF files and directories containing multiple PDFs.

parameters:
· path: A Path object representing the location of the PDF file or directory containing PDF files to be processed.

Code Description: The function starts by asserting that the necessary API key and endpoint for Azure Document Intelligence are provided in RD_AGENT_SETTINGS. It then initializes an empty dictionary, content_dict, to store the extracted content from each PDF file. The path is resolved to its absolute form using the resolve() method of the Path object. If the resolved path points to a single file, it checks if the file has a .pdf extension and processes it using the load_and_process_one_pdf_by_azure_document_intelligence function. If the path points to a directory, the function iterates over all files in the directory (and subdirectories) using rglob("*"). For each file that is a PDF, it extracts its content using the same processing function. The extracted content for each PDF is stored in content_dict with the file's absolute path as the key.

Note: This function requires that Azure Document Intelligence service is properly set up with valid API key and endpoint URL. It also assumes that the path parameter points to a valid PDF file or directory containing PDF files.

Output Example: {'/path/to/document1.pdf': 'This is the first page of document 1. It provides an overview...', '/path/to/document2.pdf': 'Introduction to document 2, followed by detailed analysis...'}
## FunctionDef extract_first_page_screenshot_from_pdf(pdf_path)
**extract_first_page_screenshot_from_pdf**: This function extracts a screenshot of the first page from a PDF file and returns it as an image object.
parameters:
· pdf_path: A string representing the path to the PDF file or a URL pointing to the PDF file.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the provided `pdf_path` corresponds to an existing file on the local filesystem. If the file does not exist, it treats `pdf_path` as a URL and fetches the PDF content from that URL using the requests library. It then opens the PDF document using PyMuPDF (fitz), which is capable of handling both local files and streams.

Once the document is loaded, the function accesses the first page of the PDF by calling `load_page(0)`. The `get_pixmap()` method on this page object retrieves a pixel map representation of the page. This pixmap is then converted into an image using Python's PIL (Pillow) library with the `Image.frombytes` method, specifying "RGB" as the mode and providing the width, height, and sample data from the pixmap.

The resulting image object, which represents the screenshot of the first page of the PDF, is returned by the function.

Note: The function requires that the PyMuPDF (fitz) library and the Pillow library are installed in the Python environment. Additionally, if `pdf_path` is a URL, ensure that the requests library is also available.

Output Example: If the provided PDF file has its first page displaying a colorful landscape image, the returned image object would be an RGB representation of this landscape image with dimensions corresponding to the original page size of the PDF document. This image can then be used for further processing or displayed in applications that support image objects.
