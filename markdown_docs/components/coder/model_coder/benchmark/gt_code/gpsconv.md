## ClassDef GPSConv
**GPSConv**: The GPS (General, Powerful, Scalable) graph transformer layer as described in the paper "Recipe for a General, Powerful, Scalable Graph Transformer". This class implements a graph transformer layer that combines local message passing and global attention mechanisms to process graph data.

attributes:
· channels: Size of each input sample, representing the number of features per node.
· conv: The local message passing layer, an instance of MessagePassing. If None, no local message passing is performed.
· heads: Number of multi-head-attentions used in the global attention mechanism. Default is 1.
· dropout: Dropout probability applied to intermediate embeddings to prevent overfitting. Default is 0.0.
· act: The non-linear activation function used within the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron). Can be a string or a callable function. Default is "relu".
· act_kwargs: Arguments passed to the specified activation function. Default is None.
· norm: Normalization function applied after each layer. Can be a string or a callable function. Default is "batch_norm".
· norm_kwargs: Arguments passed to the normalization function. Default is None.
· attn_type: Type of global attention mechanism used, either 'multihead' or 'performer'. Default is 'multihead'.
· attn_kwargs: Additional arguments passed to the attention layer. Default is None.

Code Description: The GPSConv class extends torch.nn.Module and implements a graph transformer layer that includes both local message passing and global attention mechanisms. It initializes with specified parameters for channels, convolutional layer, number of heads, dropout rate, activation function, normalization method, type of attention mechanism, and additional keyword arguments for these components.

The forward pass first applies the local message passing if a conv layer is provided, followed by dropout and residual connections. Normalization is applied if specified. The global attention mechanism then processes the entire graph using either MultiheadAttention or PerformerAttention based on the attn_type parameter. After applying dropout and another residual connection, normalization is again applied if required.

The outputs from both local message passing and global attention are combined, passed through an MLP, and finally normalized to produce the final output.

Note: For a practical example of using GPSConv, refer to the graph_gps.py script in the examples directory of the PyTorch Geometric repository. This class is particularly useful for tasks involving complex graph structures where both local neighborhood information and global context are important.

Output Example: Given an input tensor x with shape [num_nodes, channels], edge_index representing the edges in the graph, and batch indices if processing multiple graphs simultaneously, GPSConv will output a tensor of the same shape [num_nodes, channels] after applying the specified transformations.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, channels, conv, heads, dropout, act, act_kwargs, norm, norm_kwargs, attn_type, attn_kwargs)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the GPSConv class, setting up various components including attention mechanisms, normalization layers, and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) based on the provided parameters.

parameters:
· channels: The number of input/output features for each node.
· conv: An optional message passing layer that can be used in conjunction with the GPSConv layer. This parameter is expected to be an instance of a class derived from MessagePassing.
· heads: Number of attention heads to use in multihead attention mechanisms. Default is 1.
· dropout: Dropout rate for all dropout layers within this module. Default is 0.0, meaning no dropout.
· act: Activation function used after the first linear layer in the MLP. Supported options are "relu" and others that can be resolved by `activation_resolver`. Default is "relu".
· act_kwargs: Optional dictionary containing keyword arguments for the activation function specified by `act`.
· norm: Type of normalization to apply. Options include "batch_norm" and others that can be resolved by `normalization_resolver`. Default is "batch_norm".
· norm_kwargs: Optional dictionary containing keyword arguments for the normalization layer.
· attn_type: Specifies the type of attention mechanism to use, either "multihead" or "performer". Default is "multihead".
· attn_kwargs: Optional dictionary containing additional keyword arguments for the specified attention mechanism.

Code Description: The constructor initializes several key components of the GPSConv class. It starts by calling the superclass's initializer using `super().__init__()`. Then, it assigns the provided parameters to instance variables. 

The attention mechanism is instantiated based on the `attn_type` parameter. If "multihead" is specified, a `torch.nn.MultiheadAttention` layer is created with the given number of channels and heads. For "performer", an instance of `PerformerAttention` is created instead. An error is raised for unsupported attention types.

An MLP is constructed using a sequence of layers: two linear transformations, dropout layers, and an activation function. The MLP's architecture is designed to process node features by first expanding them, applying non-linearity, reducing dimensionality back to the original size, and finally applying dropout again.

Normalization layers are created based on the `norm` parameter. Three normalization layers (`norm1`, `norm2`, `norm3`) are instantiated with the same type and parameters. The presence of a "batch" parameter in the forward method signature of these normalization layers is checked to determine if batch normalization is being used, which influences how data is passed through these layers.

Note: Usage points include setting up the GPSConv layer with specific attention mechanisms and normalization strategies tailored to the needs of the graph neural network. Developers can customize the behavior by adjusting parameters such as `channels`, `heads`, `dropout`, `act`, `norm`, and their respective keyword arguments (`act_kwargs` and `norm_kwargs`). The flexibility in choosing different types of attention mechanisms (e.g., "multihead", "performer") allows for experimentation with various graph processing strategies.

### FunctionDef reset_parameters(self)
**reset_parameters**: Resets all learnable parameters of the module.
parameters:
· No explicit parameters: This function does not take any input parameters directly.

Code Description: The `reset_parameters` method is designed to reinitialize all the learnable parameters within a specific model or module. It ensures that each component's parameters are set back to their initial state, which can be crucial for training stability and reproducibility in machine learning models. The function checks if certain components (`self.conv`, `self.norm1`, `self.norm2`, `self.norm3`) are not None before calling their respective `reset_parameters` methods. This is a safeguard against potential errors that could arise from attempting to reset parameters of uninitialized or non-existent components.

The method specifically targets the following parts of the module:
- `self.conv`: If this convolutional layer exists, its parameters are reset.
- `self.attn`: The attention mechanism's parameters are reset using a private method `_reset_parameters`.
- `self.mlp`: A multi-layer perceptron's parameters are reset using an external function `reset`.
- `self.norm1`, `self.norm2`, `self.norm3`: If these normalization layers exist, their parameters are reset. These could be layer normalization or batch normalization layers used in the model.

This method is typically called at the beginning of training a model to ensure that all weights and biases start from a consistent state, which can help in achieving better convergence during the optimization process.

Note: Usage points.
- This function should be invoked before starting the training loop to initialize parameters.
- It's particularly useful when restarting training or experimenting with different initializations without reinitializing the entire model object.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x, edge_index, batch)
**forward**: Runs the forward pass of the module, integrating both local message passing (MPNN) and global attention mechanisms to process graph data.

**parameters**:
· x: A tensor representing node features.
· edge_index: An adjacency list or a dense matrix describing the connectivity between nodes in the graph.
· batch: An optional tensor that maps each node to its respective graph in a batched input. This is useful when processing multiple graphs simultaneously.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the local message passing layer.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if a local MPNN (Message Passing Neural Network) convolutional layer (`self.conv`) is defined. If it is, the node features `x` are processed through this layer using the provided `edge_index`. Dropout is applied to prevent overfitting, and residual connections are used by adding the original input `x` back to the output of the convolutional layer. Normalization (`self.norm1`) can be applied either with or without batch information depending on the configuration.

Next, the function prepares for global processing by converting the sparse graph representation into a dense format using `to_dense_batch`. This step is necessary because attention mechanisms typically operate on dense matrices. Depending on whether `self.attn` is an instance of `torch.nn.MultiheadAttention` or `PerformerAttention`, the appropriate method is called to apply global attention. Dropout is again applied, and residual connections are used by adding the original input `x` back to the output.

The outputs from both local and global processing steps are combined through summation (`hs.append(h)` for each step). An additional MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) layer (`self.mlp`) is then applied to this combined output, followed by optional normalization (`self.norm3`). The final processed node features are returned.

**Note**: This function is designed to handle graph data efficiently, especially when dealing with multiple graphs in a batch. It leverages both local and global information to enhance the representation of nodes within the graph structure.

**Output Example**: If `x` is a tensor of shape `[num_nodes, num_features]`, the output will also be a tensor of the same shape, representing the updated node features after processing through the module's layers. For instance, if `x` has dimensions `[100, 64]`, indicating 100 nodes with 64 features each, the output will have the same dimensions, reflecting the transformed node representations.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: This function provides a string representation of an instance of the GPSConv class, which is useful for debugging and logging purposes.
parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The __repr__ method does not take any additional parameters beyond the implicit self parameter that refers to the instance of the class.

Code Description: The __repr__ method constructs a string that includes the class name along with key attributes of the GPSConv instance. It specifically includes the number of channels, the convolutional layer configuration (conv), the number of attention heads (heads), and the type of attention mechanism used (attn_type). This detailed representation allows developers to quickly understand the state and configuration of a GPSConv object at any point in their code.

Note: The __repr__ method is intended for unambiguous representation, meaning it should ideally return a string that could be used to recreate the object. However, in this case, while it provides valuable information about the object's attributes, it does not include all necessary parameters to fully reconstruct an identical GPSConv instance without additional context.

Output Example: An example of what the __repr__ method might output for a particular instance of GPSConv could be:
GPSConv(128, conv=Conv2d(128, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1)), heads=4, attn_type='full')
