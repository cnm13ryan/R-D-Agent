## ClassDef ModelMultiProcessEvolvingStrategy
**ModelMultiProcessEvolvingStrategy**: This class extends `MultiProcessEvolvingStrategy` and is designed to implement a task using an evolving strategy approach, specifically tailored for model-related tasks. It manages the process of generating code by leveraging queried knowledge about similar successful tasks and former failed attempts.

attributes:
· target_task: An instance of `ModelTask`, representing the specific task that needs to be implemented.
· queried_knowledge: An optional parameter of type `CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge` that contains information about previously successful and failed tasks related to the model.

Code Description: The class primarily consists of two methods. The first method, `implement_one_task`, is responsible for generating code for a given task by constructing system and user prompts based on provided knowledge. It uses a template rendering engine (`Environment`) to fill in placeholders with relevant information such as scenario descriptions, failed knowledge traces, and base code. The method attempts to reduce the length of the user prompt if it exceeds a predefined token limit by iteratively removing elements from the list of former failed or similar successful knowledge until the prompt is within the acceptable length.

The second method, `assign_code_list_to_evo`, takes a list of generated codes (`code_list`) and an evolving strategy object (`evo`). It assigns each piece of code to its corresponding sub-task in the evolving strategy's workspace. If a workspace for a particular task does not exist, it creates one using `ModelFBWorkspace` and injects the generated code into this workspace.

Note: The class is designed to work within an environment where tasks are managed through an evolving strategy framework, and code generation is facilitated by leveraging historical knowledge about similar tasks. It assumes the existence of certain global variables such as `coder_prompts`, `APIBackend`, `LLM_SETTINGS`, and `CoSTEER_SETTINGS`.

Output Example: The output of `implement_one_task` would be a string containing the generated code for the specified task. For instance, if the task involves modifying a neural network model to improve accuracy, the output might look like this:

```
def improved_model(input_shape):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(Dropout(0.5))
    model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
    return model
```

This code snippet represents a simplified example of what the generated output might look like, assuming the task involves creating or modifying a neural network architecture.
### FunctionDef implement_one_task(self, target_task, queried_knowledge)
**implement_one_task**: This function implements a single task by generating code based on the provided task information and any queried knowledge related to similar successful tasks and former failed attempts.

parameters:
· target_task: An instance of ModelTask that contains details about the task to be implemented.
· queried_knowledge: An optional parameter, an instance of CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge, which includes previously gathered knowledge about similar successful tasks and former failed traces relevant to the current task.

Code Description: The function starts by retrieving the task information from the target_task object. It then checks if queried_knowledge is provided; if so, it extracts lists of similar successful knowledge and former failed traces related to the current task's model information string. If queried_knowledge is not provided, these lists default to empty.

The system prompt is constructed using a template from coder_prompts with placeholders for scenario details, former failed knowledge, and the base code of the target_task. The scenario details are fetched based on the model type specified in the target_task.

For the user prompt, another template from coder_prompts is used, incorporating the model information string, similar successful knowledge, and former failed traces. To ensure that the combined system and user prompts do not exceed a predefined token limit (LLM_SETTINGS.chat_token_limit), the function iteratively reduces the length of the user prompt by removing elements from the lists of former failed knowledge or similar successful knowledge until the token count is within limits.

Once the prompts are ready, they are used to generate code through an API call. The generated code is expected to be in JSON format with a key "code", which is then extracted and returned as the output of the function.

Note: This function relies on external components such as Environment from Jinja2 for template rendering, APIBackend for handling API calls, and LLM_SETTINGS for configuration settings like chat_token_limit. It also assumes that coder_prompts contains predefined templates for system and user prompts.

Output Example: {"code": "def example_function():\n    print('Hello, World!')"}

This output represents a simplified example of the code that might be generated by this function, where the key "code" holds the actual Python code as a string.

### FunctionDef assign_code_list_to_evo(self, code_list, evo)
**assign_code_list_to_evo**: This function assigns a list of code strings to respective sub-workspaces within an evolving strategy object, ensuring each sub-task is associated with its corresponding code.

**parameters**:
· code_list: A list of code strings where each string represents the code intended for a specific sub-task.
· evo: An instance of ModelMultiProcessEvolvingStrategy that contains sub-tasks and their respective workspaces.

**Code Description**: The function iterates over the indices of the `evo.sub_tasks` list. For each index, it checks if the corresponding entry in `code_list` is not None. If the code for a particular task is provided (i.e., not None), the function then checks whether there is an existing workspace for that sub-task in `evo.sub_workspace_list`. If no workspace exists (None), a new ModelFBWorkspace object is created and assigned to that index, with the target_task set to the corresponding sub-task from `evo.sub_tasks`. After ensuring a workspace is available, the function injects the code into the workspace using the `inject_code` method, specifying "model.py" as the file name for the injected code. This process repeats for all entries in `code_list`.

**Note**: The function assumes that `code_list` and `evo.sub_tasks` have the same length and that each index corresponds to a matching sub-task and its associated code. If `code_list[index]` is None, the corresponding workspace remains unchanged.

**Output Example**: Assuming `evo` initially has no workspaces assigned (all entries in `sub_workspace_list` are None) and `code_list` contains two Python scripts, after calling `assign_code_list_to_evo`, `evo.sub_workspace_list` will contain two ModelFBWorkspace objects. Each object will have injected the respective code from `code_list` into a file named "model.py". The sub-tasks associated with these workspaces are those found in `evo.sub_tasks`.
