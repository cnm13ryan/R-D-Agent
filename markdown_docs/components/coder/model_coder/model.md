## ClassDef ModelTask
**ModelTask**: Represents a specific machine learning task within a model framework, inheriting from CoSTEERTask. It encapsulates details such as the name, description, architecture, formulation, variables, hyperparameters, and type of the model.

attributes:
· name: A string representing the name of the model task.
· description: A string providing a detailed description of what the model task entails.
· architecture: A string specifying the architectural design or structure of the model.
· hyperparameters: A dictionary containing key-value pairs for the hyperparameters used in the model.
· formulation: An optional string that describes the mathematical formulation or approach of the model.
· variables: An optional dictionary detailing the input and output variables of the model.
· model_type: An optional string indicating the type of model, such as Tabular, TimesSeries, Graph, or XGBoost.

Code Description: The ModelTask class is designed to store comprehensive information about a machine learning task. It initializes with essential attributes like name, description, architecture, and hyperparameters, while formulation, variables, and model_type are optional. The get_task_information method constructs a formatted string summarizing the task's details, which can be useful for logging or documentation purposes. Additionally, the from_dict static method allows creating an instance of ModelTask directly from a dictionary, facilitating easy instantiation from serialized data. The __repr__ method provides a concise representation of the object, showing its class name and the task's name.

Note: When using ModelTask, ensure that all required parameters (name, description, architecture, hyperparameters) are provided during initialization. Optional parameters can be omitted if not applicable to the specific model task.

Output Example: <ModelTask MyModelTask>
This output represents an instance of ModelTask named "MyModelTask". The __repr__ method is responsible for generating this string representation, which includes the class name and the task's name.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, name, description, architecture)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the ModelTask class with specified attributes related to model configuration and description.

parameters:
· name: A string representing the name of the model task.
· description: A string providing a detailed description of what the model task entails.
· architecture: A string describing the architectural design or structure of the model.
· *args: Variable length argument list, typically used for additional positional arguments that are not explicitly defined in the method signature.
· hyperparameters: A dictionary where keys and values are strings representing the hyperparameters and their corresponding settings for the model.
· formulation: An optional string describing the mathematical or logical formulation of the model task. Defaults to None if not provided.
· variables: An optional dictionary with keys and values as strings, detailing the variables used in the model. Defaults to None if not provided.
· model_type: An optional string specifying the type of the model (e.g., Tabular for tabular models, TimesSeries for time series models, Graph for graph models, XGBoost for XGBoost models). Defaults to None if not specified.
· **kwargs: Variable length keyword argument list, used for additional named arguments that are not explicitly defined in the method signature.

Code Description: The __init__ function is a constructor for the ModelTask class. It initializes several attributes of the class instance based on the provided parameters. These include the model's name, description, architecture, hyperparameters, and optionally its formulation, variables, and type. The *args and **kwargs allow for flexibility in passing additional arguments that might be required by the superclass or other parts of the application without explicitly defining them in the method signature. The super().__init__(name=name, *args, **kwargs) call ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed.

Note: When creating an instance of ModelTask, it is essential to provide at least the name, description, and architecture parameters as they are not optional. Hyperparameters should be provided as a dictionary with appropriate key-value pairs representing the settings for the model's hyperparameters. The formulation, variables, and model_type parameters can be omitted if they do not apply to the specific use case of the model task being defined.

### FunctionDef get_task_information(self)
**get_task_information**: This function compiles a detailed description of a model task by aggregating various attributes into a formatted string. It is designed to provide an overview of the task's name, description, formulation, architecture, variables, hyperparameters, and model type.

**parameters**:
· No explicit parameters are required for this method as it accesses instance variables directly from the class where it is defined.

**Code Description**: The function initializes a string `task_desc` with the task's name and description. It then conditionally appends other attributes (formulation, variables) to this string only if they are not None or empty. This ensures that the output does not include unnecessary lines for missing information. The architecture and model type are always included in the final string as these are assumed to be essential components of any task description.

**Note**: Usage points. This function is particularly useful when generating reports, summaries, or logs about specific tasks within a machine learning project. It provides a standardized way to document the details of each task, which can be crucial for reproducibility and collaboration among team members.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
```
name: Image Classification
description: A model designed to classify images into predefined categories.
formulation: Supervised learning approach using labeled dataset.
architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
variables: Input image, output class labels
hyperparameters: Learning rate=0.001, batch size=32, epochs=50
model_type: Classification
```

### FunctionDef from_dict(dict)
**from_dict**: This function initializes a `ModelTask` object using a dictionary where keys correspond to the attributes of the `ModelTask` class.

parameters:
· dict: A dictionary containing key-value pairs that match the parameters expected by the `ModelTask` constructor.

Code Description: The `from_dict` function takes a single argument, which is a dictionary. This dictionary should have keys that are compatible with the parameters of the `ModelTask` class's constructor. Inside the function, the dictionary is unpacked using the double asterisk (`**`) operator, and its contents are passed as keyword arguments to the `ModelTask` constructor. The result is a new instance of `ModelTask` initialized with the values provided in the dictionary.

Note: It is crucial that the keys in the dictionary match exactly with the parameter names expected by the `ModelTask` class's constructor. If there are any discrepancies, such as missing keys or extra keys not recognized by the constructor, this will result in an error during object creation.

Output Example: Assuming `ModelTask` has parameters `name`, `description`, and `priority`, a dictionary like `{"name": "Data Analysis", "description": "Perform data analysis on sales figures", "priority": 1}` would be passed to the function. The output would be an instance of `ModelTask` with these attributes set accordingly:
- name: Data Analysis
- description: Perform data analysis on sales figures
- priority: 1
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: This method returns a string representation of an instance of the ModelTask class, which is useful for debugging and logging purposes.
parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The __repr__ method does not take any additional parameters beyond the implicit self parameter, which refers to the instance of the class.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function __repr__ is a special method in Python that is intended to return an official string representation of an object. This string should be unambiguous and, if possible, match the code necessary to recreate the object. In this specific implementation, the method returns a formatted string that includes the class name (obtained through self.__class__.__name__) and the value of the instance's 'name' attribute. The use of f-string formatting allows for an efficient and readable way to construct the return string.

Note: Usage points.
This method is automatically called by built-in functions like repr() and when using the interactive interpreter to display objects. It is particularly useful during debugging as it provides a clear and concise description of the object, including its class type and a relevant identifier (in this case, the name attribute).

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If an instance of ModelTask named 'task1' with the attribute 'name' set to 'DataProcessing', calling repr(task1) would output:
<ModelTask DataProcessing>

## ClassDef ModelFBWorkspace
**ModelFBWorkspace**: This class represents a workspace specifically designed for implementing PyTorch models within a structured folder system. It inherits from `FBWorkspace` and is tailored to support two different interfaces: one for qlib and another for Kaggle.

attributes:
· batch_size (int): The number of samples processed before the model is updated during training.
· num_features (int): The number of features in the input data.
· num_timesteps (int): The number of timesteps, particularly relevant for time-series data.
· num_edges (int): The number of edges, which could be relevant if the model involves graph structures.
· input_value (float): A placeholder or default value for inputs to the model.
· param_init_value (float): The initial value for parameters in the model.

Code Description: 
The `ModelFBWorkspace` class is structured around managing a PyTorch model implementation within a designated folder. This folder contains data sources and documents prepared by a method called `prepare`, as well as code files injected via `inject_code`. Specifically, it expects a file named `model.py` that defines a variable `model_cls`, which should be an instance of `torch.nn.Module`.

The class supports two interfaces:
- For qlib: A script is generated to import the model from `model.py`, initialize it with specific parameters, and then verify its functionality.
- For Kaggle: A script is generated to call predefined fit and predict functions within `model.py`.

The `hash_func` method generates a hash based on several parameters (batch size, number of features, timesteps, edges, input value, parameter initialization value) and the contents of code files in the workspace. This hash is used by the caching mechanism provided by `cache_with_pickle`.

The `execute` method orchestrates the execution process:
1. It first calls the parent class's `execute` method.
2. Depending on the target task version (either 1 or 2), it initializes a Docker environment (`QTDockerEnv` for qlib, `KGDockerEnv` for Kaggle).
3. It prepares the Docker environment and then constructs a script to execute the model based on the specified interface version.
4. The script is run within the Docker environment, and results are captured.
5. If an error occurs during execution, it catches the exception and logs the error message.
6. Finally, it returns feedback from the execution process and any output generated by the model.

Note: Usage points include setting up the workspace with necessary data and code files, configuring parameters for the model, and invoking the `execute` method to run the model within a Docker environment tailored to either qlib or Kaggle interfaces.

Output Example:
The return value of the `execute` method is a tuple containing two elements:
- The first element is a string providing feedback from the execution process. This could include logs, error messages, and other relevant information.
- The second element is the output generated by the model during execution, which could be predictions, loss values, or any other result depending on the specific implementation in `model.py`.

Example:
```python
execution_feedback_str = "Model initialized successfully with batch size 8, num features 10. Training completed without errors."
execution_model_output = [0.2345, 0.7655, 0.1234]  # Example output values from the model
```
### FunctionDef hash_func(self, batch_size, num_features, num_timesteps, num_edges, input_value, param_init_value)
**hash_func**: This function generates a hash string based on several input parameters and additional data stored within an instance variable `code_dict`. The generated hash is intended to uniquely identify configurations of model parameters and code files.

parameters:
· batch_size: An integer representing the number of samples processed before the model is updated. It defaults to 8.
· num_features: An integer indicating the number of features in the input data. It defaults to 10.
· num_timesteps: An integer specifying the number of time steps in the sequence data, if applicable. It defaults to 4.
· num_edges: An integer representing the number of edges in a graph structure, if relevant. This parameter is not used within the function but could be included for future extensions or additional context. It defaults to 20.
· input_value: A float value that might represent an initial input or default input value used in computations. It defaults to 1.0.
· param_init_value: A float representing the initial value of model parameters before training. It defaults to 1.0.

Code Description: The function starts by constructing a string `target_file_name` using the provided parameters, excluding `num_edges`. This string is formatted in a way that each parameter's value is concatenated with an underscore. Following this, the function iterates over the keys of `self.code_dict`, which presumably contains file names or identifiers as keys and some associated data (possibly hashes or versions) as values. For each key, it appends the corresponding value from `self.code_dict` to `target_file_name`. After constructing the complete string, the function computes an MD5 hash of this string using a hypothetical `md5_hash` function and returns the resulting hash.

Note: The function assumes that `self.code_dict` is a dictionary attribute of the class instance. It also relies on the existence of an `md5_hash` function to compute the hash, which should be defined elsewhere in the codebase. Developers using this function need to ensure that `self.code_dict` is properly initialized and populated with relevant data before calling `hash_func`.

Output Example: If `batch_size=8`, `num_features=10`, `num_timesteps=4`, `input_value=1.0`, `param_init_value=1.0`, and `self.code_dict={'file1.py': 'v1', 'file2.py': 'v2'}`, the function would generate a string like "8_10_4_1.0_1.0_v1_v2" and return its MD5 hash, which might look something like "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e". The actual hash value will depend on the exact implementation of `md5_hash`.
***
### FunctionDef execute(self, batch_size, num_features, num_timesteps, num_edges, input_value, param_init_value)
**execute**: This function prepares and executes a model based on specified parameters and task version, capturing feedback and output from the execution process.

**parameters**:
· batch_size: An integer representing the number of samples processed before the model is updated. Default value is 8.
· num_features: An integer indicating the number of features in the input data. Default value is 10.
· num_timesteps: An integer specifying the number of time steps for temporal models. Default value is 4.
· num_edges: An integer denoting the number of edges in graph-based models. Default value is 20.
· input_value: A float representing a default or initial input value used in model computations. Default value is 1.0.
· param_init_value: A float indicating the initial value for parameters in the model. Default value is 1.0.

**Code Description**: The function starts by invoking the `execute` method of its superclass, ensuring any necessary setup from the parent class is performed. It then determines which Docker environment to use based on the version specified in `self.target_task.version`. For version 1, it initializes a `QTDockerEnv`; for version 2, it uses a `KGDockerEnv`.

Next, the function prepares the execution environment by calling `qtde.prepare()`. Depending on the task version, it constructs a string of Python code (`dump_code`) to be executed. For version 1, this involves formatting a template with the provided parameters and appending additional content from a file named 'model_execute_template_v1.txt'. For version 2, it simply reads the contents of 'model_execute_template_v2.txt'.

The constructed or read `dump_code` is then passed to the Docker environment's method `dump_python_code_run_and_get_results`, which executes the code and returns logs and results. If no results are returned (indicating an error), a `RuntimeError` is raised with the log information.

In case of any exceptions during execution, they are caught, and an error message along with the traceback is stored in `execution_feedback_str`. The function also ensures that if the feedback string exceeds 2000 characters, it is truncated to include only the first 1000 and last 1000 characters, with a placeholder indicating hidden content.

**Note**: This function requires that the Docker environments (`QTDockerEnv` or `KGDockerEnv`) are properly set up and accessible. Additionally, the template files ('model_execute_template_v1.txt' and 'model_execute_template_v2.txt') must exist in the same directory as this script for version 1 and version 2 tasks respectively.

**Output Example**: The function returns a tuple containing two elements:
- `execution_feedback_str`: A string providing feedback from the model execution, which could include logs or error messages.
- `execution_model_output`: An object representing the output of the model execution. This could be `None` if an error occurred during execution.

Example return values:
("Model executed successfully with no errors.", [0.123456789, 0.987654321])
("Execution error: ValueError('Invalid input')\nTraceback: ...", None)
