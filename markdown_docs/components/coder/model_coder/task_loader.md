## FunctionDef extract_model_from_doc(doc_content)
**extract_model_from_doc**: This function extracts model information from a given document content string. It processes the text to identify and parse structured data representing models, including their names, formulations, and descriptions.

parameters:
· doc_content: A string containing the document's textual content from which model information is to be extracted.

Code Description: The function initializes a chat session using an API backend with a predefined system prompt designed for extracting model formulations. It then iteratively attempts to extract model information up to 10 times, adjusting its approach based on the success of previous attempts. During each iteration, it sends the document content (or a modified version if parsing fails) to the chat session and expects a JSON-formatted response encapsulated in triple backticks. The function uses regular expressions to locate this JSON string within the response, parses it into a dictionary, and adds any successfully parsed models to a result dictionary. If no valid model information is extracted after 10 attempts, the process terminates without adding anything to the result dictionary.

Note: This function relies on external API calls and assumes that the chat session can understand and respond appropriately based on the provided system prompt. The quality of the extracted data depends heavily on the effectiveness of this interaction.

Output Example: 
{
    "ModelA": {
        "description": "This is a description of Model A.",
        "formulation": "Equation for Model A",
        "variables": ["var1", "var2"]
    },
    "ModelB": {
        "description": "Description of Model B.",
        "formulation": "Equation for Model B",
        "variables": ["varX", "varY"]
    }
}
## FunctionDef merge_file_to_model_dict_to_model_dict(file_to_model_dict)
**merge_file_to_model_dict_to_model_dict**: This function consolidates model information from multiple files into a single dictionary, ensuring each model name appears only once by selecting the entry with the longest formulation if duplicates exist.

parameters:
· file_to_model_dict: A dictionary where keys are file names and values are dictionaries mapping model names to their respective details (description, formulation, variables).

Code Description: The function starts by initializing an empty dictionary named `model_dict`. It then iterates over each file name in the input dictionary. For each file, it further iterates through its associated models. If a model name is not already a key in `model_dict`, it is added with an empty list as its value. Each model's details from the current file are appended to this list.

After collecting all models and their details across files, the function creates another dictionary named `model_dict_simple_deduplication`. This new dictionary ensures that each model name appears only once. If a model has multiple entries (indicating it was found in more than one file), the entry with the longest formulation is chosen. If there's only one entry for a model, it is directly added to the new dictionary.

Note: This function is typically used after extracting models from documents, as seen in the `load` method of `ModelExperimentLoaderFromPDFfiles`. It helps in deduplicating and consolidating model information before further processing or loading into an experiment loader.

Output Example: 
{
    'modelA': {'description': 'Description of Model A', 'formulation': 'Longest formulation for Model A...', 'variables': ['var1', 'var2']},
    'modelB': {'description': 'Description of Model B', 'formulation': 'Formulation for Model B...', 'variables': ['var3']}
}
## FunctionDef extract_model_from_docs(docs_dict)
**extract_model_from_docs**: This function processes a dictionary of document contents to extract model information from each document. It iterates over each document, utilizing another function `extract_model_from_doc` to parse and retrieve structured data representing models.

parameters:
· docs_dict: A dictionary where keys are document names (or identifiers) and values are strings containing the textual content of those documents.

Code Description: The function initializes an empty dictionary named `model_dict`. It then iterates over each key-value pair in the input dictionary `docs_dict`, where the key is a document name and the value is the document's content. For each document, it calls the `extract_model_from_doc` function with the document content as its argument. The result from `extract_model_from_doc`, which is a dictionary containing extracted model information, is then stored in `model_dict` under the corresponding document name. After processing all documents, the function returns `model_dict`.

Note: This function relies on the `extract_model_from_doc` function to perform the actual extraction of model information from each document's content. The quality and structure of the output depend on how effectively `extract_model_from_doc` processes the input text.

Output Example:
{
    "document1.txt": {
        "ModelA": {
            "description": "This is a description of Model A.",
            "formulation": "Equation for Model A",
            "variables": ["var1", "var2"]
        },
        "ModelB": {
            "description": "Description of Model B.",
            "formulation": "Equation for Model B",
            "variables": ["varX", "varY"]
        }
    },
    "document2.txt": {
        "ModelC": {
            "description": "This is a description of Model C.",
            "formulation": "Equation for Model C",
            "variables": ["var3", "var4"]
        }
    }
}
## ClassDef ModelExperimentLoaderFromDict
**ModelExperimentLoaderFromDict**: This class is designed to load model experiment data from a dictionary structure. It inherits from `ModelTaskLoader` and implements the `load` method to parse a given dictionary containing model details into a structured format of `QlibModelExperiment`.

attributes:
· model_dict: A dictionary where each key-value pair represents a model name and its corresponding attributes such as description, formulation, architecture, variables, hyperparameters, and model type.

Code Description: The `load` method iterates over the entries in the provided `model_dict`. For each entry, it creates an instance of `ModelTask`, initializing it with the relevant data extracted from the dictionary. These `ModelTask` instances are collected into a list named `task_l`. Finally, the method returns a `QlibModelExperiment` object that encapsulates all the tasks loaded from the dictionary.

Note: This class is typically used in scenarios where model configurations and details are already available in a structured dictionary format, allowing for easy instantiation of model experiments without needing to parse external files or documents.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming `model_dict` contains:
```python
{
    "ModelA": {
        "description": "This is Model A",
        "formulation": "Formulation for Model A",
        "architecture": "Architecture details for Model A",
        "variables": ["var1", "var2"],
        "hyperparameters": {"param1": 0.5, "param2": 10},
        "model_type": "TypeA"
    },
    "ModelB": {
        "description": "This is Model B",
        "formulation": "Formulation for Model B",
        "architecture": "Architecture details for Model B",
        "variables": ["var3", "var4"],
        "hyperparameters": {"param1": 0.7, "param2": 15},
        "model_type": "TypeB"
    }
}
```
The `load` method would return a `QlibModelExperiment` object containing two `ModelTask` instances, each representing ModelA and ModelB with their respective attributes populated as specified in the dictionary.
### FunctionDef load(self, model_dict)
**load**: This function loads model tasks from a dictionary and returns them encapsulated within a QlibModelExperiment object.

parameters:
· model_dict: A dictionary where each key is a model name (string) and each value is another dictionary containing details about the model such as description, formulation, architecture, variables, hyperparameters, and model type.

Code Description: The function iterates over each item in the provided dictionary. For each model entry, it creates an instance of ModelTask using the data from the dictionary. Each ModelTask object represents a specific task with attributes like name, description, formulation, architecture, variables, hyperparameters, and model_type. These tasks are collected into a list named task_l. Finally, the function returns a QlibModelExperiment object that contains all these sub-tasks.

Note: The function assumes that the input dictionary is structured correctly with all necessary keys for each model entry. It does not perform any validation on the data within the dictionary or handle exceptions related to missing keys or incorrect data types.

Output Example: If the input dictionary were:
{
    "ModelA": {
        "description": "First Model",
        "formulation": "Linear Regression",
        "architecture": "Simple Linear",
        "variables": ["x1", "x2"],
        "hyperparameters": {"alpha": 0.5},
        "model_type": "Regression"
    },
    "ModelB": {
        "description": "Second Model",
        "formulation": "Logistic Regression",
        "architecture": "Binary Logistic",
        "variables": ["y1", "y2"],
        "hyperparameters": {"beta": 0.3},
        "model_type": "Classification"
    }
}

The output would be a QlibModelExperiment object containing two ModelTask objects, each representing one of the models defined in the input dictionary.

## ClassDef ModelExperimentLoaderFromPDFfiles
**ModelExperimentLoaderFromPDFfiles**: This class is designed to load and process model experiments from PDF files. It inherits from `ModelTaskLoader` and provides a method to parse, extract, and merge information about models from one or more PDF documents into a structured dictionary format.

attributes:
· file_or_folder_path: A string representing the path to a single PDF file or a folder containing multiple PDF files that need to be processed.

Code Description: The `load` method of this class is responsible for handling the entire process of loading model experiments from PDFs. It begins by invoking the `load_and_process_pdfs_by_langchain` function, which takes the provided path (either a single file or a folder) and returns a dictionary where each key is a file path and its value is the content extracted from that PDF.

Next, the method calls `extract_model_from_docs`, passing in the dictionary of documents. This function processes the document contents to identify and extract information about models contained within them. The result is a nested dictionary structure where each top-level key represents a file name, and its corresponding value is another dictionary mapping model names to their descriptions, formulations, and variables.

The extracted model data may span multiple files, so the method then uses `merge_file_to_model_dict_to_model_dict` to consolidate this information. This function merges all models across different files into a single dictionary where each key is a unique model name, and its value contains the aggregated description, formulation, and variables for that model.

Finally, the consolidated model data is passed to another loader class, `ModelExperimentLoaderFromDict`, which further processes this dictionary according to its own logic and returns the final structured representation of the models extracted from the PDF files.

Note: This class assumes that the functions `load_and_process_pdfs_by_langchain`, `extract_model_from_docs`, and `merge_file_to_model_dict_to_model_dict` are defined elsewhere in the codebase. It also relies on the `ModelExperimentLoaderFromDict` class to handle the final loading step.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    'model1': {
        'description': 'This is a description of model 1.',
        'formulation': 'Equation representing model 1.',
        'variables': ['var1', 'var2']
    },
    'model2': {
        'description': 'Description for model 2.',
        'formulation': 'Model 2 equation.',
        'variables': ['varA', 'varB', 'varC']
    }
}
### FunctionDef load(self, file_or_folder_path)
**load**: This function loads model experiment data from PDF files by processing their contents to extract and consolidate model information into a structured format suitable for further experimentation.

**parameters**:
· file_or_folder_path: A string representing the path to either a single PDF file or a folder containing multiple PDF files. The function will process all PDFs found at this location.

**Code Description**: The `load` method begins by invoking `load_and_process_pdfs_by_langchain`, which takes the provided file or folder path and returns a dictionary (`docs_dict`) where each key is a file path and its value is the content of that PDF. This step ensures all specified PDFs are read and their contents are accessible for further processing.

Next, the function calls `extract_model_from_docs` with `docs_dict` as an argument. This function processes each document's content to extract structured model information, returning a dictionary (`model_dict`) where keys are file names and values are dictionaries mapping model names to their respective details (description, formulation, variables). Each entry in this nested dictionary represents a distinct model found within the documents.

Following extraction, `merge_file_to_model_dict_to_model_dict` is called with `model_dict`. This function consolidates model information from multiple files into a single dictionary. If a model appears in more than one file, it selects the entry with the longest formulation to ensure each model name is unique and its most comprehensive details are retained.

Finally, the consolidated `model_dict` is passed to the `load` method of an instance of `ModelExperimentLoaderFromDict`. This class processes the dictionary into a structured format of `QlibModelExperiment`, which encapsulates all models as `ModelTask` instances. The resulting `QlibModelExperiment` object is then returned by the `load` function, ready for use in model experimentation.

**Note**: This function is designed to handle both individual PDF files and directories containing multiple PDFs. It relies on external functions (`load_and_process_pdfs_by_langchain`, `extract_model_from_docs`) to read and parse document contents, ensuring that the core logic remains focused on consolidating and loading model data efficiently.

**Output Example**: Assuming the provided PDF files contain information about models "ModelA" and "ModelB", the output of this function could be a `QlibModelExperiment` object encapsulating two `ModelTask` instances. Each instance would represent one of the models with its respective attributes populated as follows:

```python
{
    "ModelA": {
        "description": "Description of Model A",
        "formulation": "Formulation for Model A...",
        "variables": ["var1", "var2"]
    },
    "ModelB": {
        "description": "Description of Model B",
        "formulation": "Formulation for Model B...",
        "variables": ["var3", "var4"]
    }
}
```

The `QlibModelExperiment` object would contain these models, ready to be used in further experimentation or analysis.
