## FunctionDef shape_evaluator(prediction, target_shape)
**shape_evaluator**: This function evaluates whether the shape of a given prediction matches an expected target shape.
parameters:
· prediction: A numpy ndarray representing the output from a model, whose shape is to be evaluated.
· target_shape: An optional tuple specifying the expected shape of the prediction. If not provided, it defaults to None.

Code Description: The function first checks if either the prediction or the target_shape is None. If so, it returns a message indicating that no evaluation was conducted and False as the result. Otherwise, it retrieves the shape of the prediction using the .shape attribute. It then compares this shape with the provided target_shape. If they match, it returns a success message stating that the output shape is correct along with True. If they do not match, it returns an error message detailing the expected and actual shapes, followed by False.

Note: This function is useful for validating the output of models where the dimensions of the output are critical to further processing or analysis. It ensures that the model's predictions conform to the expected format before proceeding with subsequent steps in a workflow.

Output Example: If the prediction has a shape of (10, 20) and the target_shape is also (10, 20), the function will return ("The shape of the output is correct.", True). Conversely, if the prediction's shape is (15, 25) while the target_shape remains (10, 20), it will return ("The shape of the output is incorrect. Expected (10, 20), but got (15, 25).", False).
## FunctionDef value_evaluator(prediction, target)
**value_evaluator**: This function evaluates the accuracy of a model's prediction by comparing it to a target value using the mean absolute difference metric.

parameters:
· prediction: A numpy array representing the output generated by the model.
· target: A numpy array representing the ground truth or expected output.

Code Description: The function first checks if either the prediction or the target is None. If the prediction is None, it returns a message indicating that no output was generated from the model and skips value evaluation, returning False as the second element of the tuple to indicate failure in evaluation. Similarly, if the target is None, it returns a message stating that no ground truth output was provided, making value evaluation impractical, again with False as the second element of the tuple.

If both prediction and target are not None, the function proceeds to calculate the mean absolute difference between the target and the prediction arrays. This metric provides an average measure of how much the predicted values deviate from the actual values. The result is then formatted into a string that includes this calculated difference along with a message indicating whether the output value is considered correct based on a predefined threshold (in this case, 0.1). If the mean absolute difference is less than 0.1, it returns True as the second element of the tuple, signifying that the prediction is deemed correct; otherwise, it returns False.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where model predictions need to be validated against known outcomes, such as in regression tasks or when assessing the performance of predictive models in machine learning applications.

Output Example: 
If the mean absolute difference between the target and prediction arrays is 0.05, the function would return:
("The value of the output is correct. The mean absolute difference is 0.05.", True)

If the mean absolute difference is 0.12, the function would return:
("The value of the output is correct. The mean absolute difference is 0.12.", False)
## ClassDef ModelCodeEvaluator
**ModelCodeEvaluator**: This class is designed to evaluate a given model implementation against a target task and an optional ground truth implementation. It generates feedback based on execution and value criteria, using prompts rendered from predefined templates.

attributes:
· target_task: An instance of Task representing the task for which the model is being evaluated.
· implementation: An instance of Workspace containing the code to be evaluated.
· gt_implementation: An optional instance of Workspace containing the ground truth or reference code against which the model's implementation will be compared.
· model_execution_feedback: A string providing feedback on how the model executed its task, defaulting to an empty string if not provided.
· model_value_feedback: A string offering feedback on the value or quality of the model's output, also defaulting to an empty string if not specified.

Code Description: The evaluate method first asserts that the input parameters are instances of the expected classes. It retrieves task information and extracts the code from the implementation workspace. System prompts are generated using a template system with the scenario description based on the target task and model type. User prompts are similarly templated, incorporating task information, the model's code, execution feedback, value feedback, and optionally ground truth code.

The method includes a mechanism to ensure that the combined user and system prompts do not exceed a predefined token limit by iteratively halving the execution feedback if necessary. Once the prompt lengths are within limits, it sends these prompts to an API backend for chat completion, which generates a critic response. This response is then returned along with None.

Note: The method assumes that certain external resources and configurations (such as evaluate_prompts, Environment, StrictUndefined, APIBackend, LLM_SETTINGS) are properly defined elsewhere in the codebase.

Output Example: ('The provided model implementation meets the requirements of the task but could be optimized for performance by reducing unnecessary computations.', None)
### FunctionDef evaluate(self, target_task, implementation, gt_implementation, model_execution_feedback, model_value_feedback)
**evaluate**: This function evaluates a given implementation against a target task using a model-based approach. It compares the provided implementation with a ground truth implementation, if available, and generates feedback based on execution and value criteria.

**parameters**:
· target_task: An instance of Task representing the specific task to be evaluated.
· implementation: An instance of Workspace containing the code that needs to be evaluated.
· gt_implementation: An optional instance of Workspace containing the ground truth code for comparison.
· model_execution_feedback: A string providing feedback on the execution of the model, defaulting to an empty string.
· model_value_feedback: A string providing feedback on the value or quality of the model's output, defaulting to an empty string.

**Code Description**: The function begins by asserting that the types of `target_task`, `implementation`, and `gt_implementation` (if provided) are correct. It retrieves task information from `target_task` and extracts the code from `implementation`. A system prompt is generated using a template, incorporating scenario descriptions if available.

The function then constructs a user prompt by rendering another template with details about the model task, the code to be evaluated, execution feedback, value feedback, and ground truth code (if applicable). If the combined length of the prompts exceeds a predefined token limit, it iteratively halves the execution feedback until the prompts fit within the limit.

A critic response is generated using an API backend by sending the constructed system and user prompts. The function returns this critic response along with `None`.

**Note**: This function relies on external components such as `Environment`, `evaluate_prompts`, `APIBackend`, `LLM_SETTINGS`, and `ModelTask`/`ModelFBWorkspace` classes, which should be properly defined and initialized in the broader context of the application.

**Output Example**: ('The provided code meets the requirements for the task. It handles edge cases effectively and performs efficiently within the given constraints.', None)

## ClassDef ModelFinalEvaluator
**ModelFinalEvaluator**: This class is designed to evaluate a model's implementation against a target task by generating feedback based on various criteria such as execution, shape, value, and code quality. It inherits from an Evaluator base class and uses prompts to interact with an API backend for generating evaluations.

attributes:
· target_task: An instance of the Task class representing the specific task that the model is being evaluated against.
· implementation: An instance of the Workspace class containing the model's implementation details.
· gt_implementation: Optionally, an instance of the Workspace class representing a ground truth or reference implementation to compare against.
· model_execution_feedback: A string providing feedback on the execution aspect of the model.
· model_shape_feedback: A string offering insights into the structural aspects of the model.
· model_value_feedback: A string giving feedback related to the value or effectiveness of the model's output.
· model_code_feedback: A string containing comments on the quality and style of the code.

Code Description: The evaluate method first asserts that the provided target_task is an instance of ModelTask, and both implementation and gt_implementation (if not None) are instances of ModelFBWorkspace. It then constructs a system prompt using a template from evaluate_prompts, incorporating scenario descriptions if available. The method iteratively constructs a user prompt by rendering feedback strings into a predefined template. If the combined length of the system and user prompts exceeds a token limit defined in LLM_SETTINGS.chat_token_limit, it truncates the execution feedback to half its size and retries until the prompt fits within the limit. Finally, it sends these prompts to an API backend for chat completion, expecting a JSON response containing final feedback and a decision (which is converted from a string to a boolean if necessary). The method returns the final feedback and decision.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that all inputs are of the correct type and that the evaluate_prompts dictionary contains the necessary templates. Developers should also be aware of the token limit set in LLM_SETTINGS.chat_token_limit, as exceeding this can lead to truncation of feedback strings.

Output Example: ('The model successfully executes the task with minor performance issues but adheres closely to the expected structure and value propositions.', True)
### FunctionDef evaluate(self, target_task, implementation, gt_implementation, model_execution_feedback, model_shape_feedback, model_value_feedback, model_code_feedback)
**evaluate**: This function evaluates a given implementation against a target task using feedback from model execution, shape, value, and code. It generates a final evaluation and decision based on these inputs.

**parameters**:
· target_task: An instance of Task representing the task to be evaluated.
· implementation: An instance of Workspace containing the implementation to evaluate.
· gt_implementation: An optional instance of Workspace containing the ground truth implementation for comparison.
· model_execution_feedback: A string providing feedback on the execution aspect of the model.
· model_shape_feedback: A string providing feedback on the shape or structure of the model.
· model_value_feedback: A string providing feedback on the value or effectiveness of the model.
· model_code_feedback: A string providing feedback on the code quality.

**Code Description**: The function begins by asserting that the provided parameters are instances of expected classes. It then constructs a system prompt using a template from `evaluate_prompts` and renders it with scenario descriptions relevant to the target task. For the user prompt, it uses another template from `evaluate_prompts`, incorporating feedback strings and task information.

The function ensures that the combined length of the system and user prompts does not exceed the token limit defined in `LLM_SETTINGS.chat_token_limit`. If necessary, it truncates the execution feedback to fit within this limit by repeatedly halving its size until the prompt is short enough. 

Once a suitable prompt is generated, the function sends it to an API backend for chat completion, requesting a JSON response. The response includes a final feedback string and a decision (either "true" or "false"), which the function converts to a boolean value before returning both as a tuple.

**Note**: Ensure that all inputs are correctly formatted instances of their respective classes. The function relies on external templates (`evaluate_prompts`) and API backend configurations, so these must be properly set up in your environment.

**Output Example**: ('The implementation meets the requirements but could benefit from additional testing.', True)
