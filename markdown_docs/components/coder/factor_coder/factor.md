## ClassDef FactorTask
**FactorTask**: The FactorTask class represents a specific task within a coding framework, designed to encapsulate details about a factor including its name, description, formulation, variables involved, resources needed, and whether it has an implementation.

attributes:
· factor_name: A string representing the name of the factor.
· factor_description: A string providing a detailed description of what the factor is or does.
· factor_formulation: A string that outlines the mathematical or logical formulation of the factor.
· variables: A dictionary containing variable names as keys and their corresponding values, used in the context of the factor.
· resource: A string indicating any resources required for the task, such as file paths or URLs.
· factor_implementation: A boolean flag indicating whether an implementation of the factor is available.

Code Description: The FactorTask class inherits from CoSTEERTask. It initializes with several parameters that define the characteristics and requirements of a specific coding task related to a factor. The constructor assigns these parameters to instance variables, ensuring they are stored for later use. Additionally, it calls the superclass's initializer with the factor_name as the name parameter.

The get_task_information method returns a formatted string containing all relevant information about the factor in a human-readable format. This can be useful for logging or displaying task details.

The get_task_information_and_implementation_result method provides similar information but in dictionary form, which is more suitable for programmatic use and integration with other systems.

A static method from_dict allows creating an instance of FactorTask directly from a dictionary containing the necessary parameters. This can simplify object creation when data is already structured as a dictionary.

The __repr__ method returns a string representation of the FactorTask instance, including its class name and factor_name, which aids in debugging and logging by providing clear identifiers for task instances.

Note: The factor_* attributes are intended to be generalized into the Task superclass in future versions. This means that these attributes may eventually be removed or renamed in later iterations of the codebase.

Output Example: When calling get_task_information on an instance of FactorTask with the following parameters:
- factor_name = "ExampleFactor"
- factor_description = "This is an example factor for demonstration purposes."
- factor_formulation = "x + y = z"
- variables = {"x": 1, "y": 2}
- resource = "http://example.com/resource"
- factor_implementation = True

The output would be:
factor_name: ExampleFactor
factor_description: This is an example factor for demonstration purposes.
factor_formulation: x + y = z
variables: {'x': 1, 'y': 2}
### FunctionDef __init__(self, factor_name, factor_description, factor_formulation)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the FactorTask class, setting up essential attributes related to factor definition and implementation.

parameters:
· factor_name: A string representing the name of the factor being defined.
· factor_description: A string providing a description or explanation of what the factor represents or measures.
· factor_formulation: A string that outlines the mathematical or logical formulation of the factor.
· *args: Variable-length argument list, used to pass additional positional arguments to the superclass initializer.
· variables: An optional dictionary containing variable names as keys and their corresponding values or descriptions. Defaults to an empty dictionary if not provided.
· resource: An optional string indicating any external resources or dependencies required for the factor implementation. Defaults to None if not specified.
· factor_implementation: A boolean flag indicating whether the factor has been implemented. Defaults to False, implying that the factor is defined but not yet implemented.
· **kwargs: Variable-length keyword argument list, used to pass additional named arguments to the superclass initializer.

Code Description: The __init__ method initializes a new instance of the FactorTask class by setting up several attributes based on the provided parameters. It assigns values to self.factor_name, self.factor_description, and self.factor_formulation directly from the corresponding input parameters. The variables parameter is assigned to self.variables, which is expected to be a dictionary containing variable names and their associated values or descriptions. The resource parameter is stored in self.factor_resources, and the factor_implementation flag is stored in self.factor_implementation.

The method also calls the initializer of the superclass (presumably a base class for FactorTask) using super().__init__(), passing the factor_name as the name argument along with any additional positional (*args) and keyword (**kwargs) arguments. This ensures that the new instance inherits properties and behaviors from its superclass, in addition to those defined specifically within the FactorTask class.

Note: Usage points include defining a new factor by providing essential details such as its name, description, and formulation. Developers can also specify any variables or resources required for the factor's implementation and indicate whether the factor has been implemented yet. This method facilitates the creation of structured and well-documented factor definitions within the system.

### FunctionDef get_task_information(self)
**get_task_information**: This function returns a formatted string containing detailed information about a factor task. The information includes the name of the factor, its description, the formulation used for the factor, and the variables involved.

parameters:
· None: This function does not accept any parameters. It relies on instance attributes to generate the output.

Code Description: The function constructs a multi-line string using f-string formatting. It accesses several attributes of the class instance (`self.factor_name`, `self.factor_description`, `self.factor_formulation`, and `self.variables`) to populate the string with relevant data about the factor task. The variables attribute, which is expected to be an iterable (like a list or dictionary), is converted to a string representation using `str(self.variables)` before being included in the output.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to log, display, or document details of a specific factor task within their application. This function provides a standardized way to retrieve all necessary information about a factor task in a single call.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
factor_name: MarketCap
factor_description: Represents the market capitalization of a stock.
factor_formulation: Price * Shares Outstanding
variables: ['Price', 'Shares Outstanding']
```
***
### FunctionDef get_task_information_and_implementation_result(self)
**get_task_information_and_implementation_result**: This function retrieves a dictionary containing detailed information about a factor task, including its name, description, formulation, variables involved, and implementation details.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The method does not accept any external parameters as it relies on the instance attributes of the class where this method is defined.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function `get_task_information_and_implementation_result` is a member method designed to encapsulate and return various pieces of information related to a factor task. It constructs a dictionary with keys that represent different aspects of the factor, such as its name, a brief description, the formulation used, the variables involved in the computation, and the implementation details. The values for these keys are derived from the instance attributes `factor_name`, `factor_description`, `factor_formulation`, `variables`, and `factor_implementation` respectively. Notably, the `variables` and `factor_implementation` attributes are converted to strings before being added to the dictionary, ensuring that they can be serialized or displayed as text.

Note: Usage points.
This function is particularly useful in scenarios where there is a need to log, display, or store comprehensive information about a factor task. It provides a structured way to access all relevant details of the task through a single method call, which can simplify the process of integrating this data into reports, user interfaces, or other systems.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
{
    "factor_name": "MarketVolatility",
    "factor_description": "Measures the volatility in market prices over a specified period.",
    "factor_formulation": "(High - Low) / Open * 100",
    "variables": "['High', 'Low', 'Open']",
    "factor_implementation": "<function MarketVolatilityImplementation at 0x7f8b4c3a9d30>"
}
***
### FunctionDef from_dict(dict)
**from_dict**: This function initializes a `FactorTask` object using a dictionary where keys correspond to the parameters of the `FactorTask` constructor.

parameters:
· dict: A dictionary containing key-value pairs that match the expected parameters for creating an instance of `FactorTask`.

Code Description: The `from_dict` function takes a single argument, which is a dictionary. This dictionary should have keys that are valid parameter names for the `FactorTask` class's constructor. Inside the function, the dictionary is unpacked using the double asterisk operator (`**`). This operator allows the dictionary to be passed as keyword arguments directly to the `FactorTask` constructor. The result of this operation is a new instance of `FactorTask`, which is then returned by the function.

Note: It is crucial that the keys in the provided dictionary match exactly with the parameter names expected by the `FactorTask` class's constructor, including their case sensitivity and any underscores. If there are discrepancies between the dictionary keys and the constructor parameters, a TypeError will be raised indicating missing or unexpected keyword arguments.

Output Example: Assuming `FactorTask` has parameters `name`, `description`, and `priority`, and you call `from_dict({'name': 'Data Processing', 'description': 'Process raw data into usable format', 'priority': 1})`, the function would return a new instance of `FactorTask` with these attributes set accordingly.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: This method provides an official string representation of the FactorTask object, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The __repr__ method does not take any additional parameters other than the implicit self parameter, which refers to the instance of the class.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __repr__ method is a special method in Python used to define the string representation of an object. It should return a string that would ideally allow someone to recreate the object if possible, or at least give a clear idea of what the object represents. In this case, the method returns a formatted string that includes the class name and the factor_name attribute of the instance. The use of self.__class__.__name__ dynamically fetches the name of the class to which the instance belongs, making the representation more flexible and applicable across different subclasses if they exist. The factor_name is enclosed in square brackets to provide additional context about the specific FactorTask instance.

Note: Usage points.
The __repr__ method is automatically called by built-in functions like repr() and when using the interactive interpreter to display objects. It is particularly useful for developers as it provides a clear, unambiguous representation of an object that can be helpful during debugging sessions or when logging information about objects in a system.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If there were an instance of FactorTask with factor_name set to 'temperature', calling repr() on this instance would produce the following string:
<FactorTask[temperature]>
***
## ClassDef FactorFBWorkspace
**FactorFBWorkspace**: This class is designed to implement a factor by writing the code to a file. It handles the execution of this code, manages input data, and outputs the factor value as a pandas DataFrame. The class also includes mechanisms for error handling and caching results.

**attributes**:
· raise_exception: A boolean flag indicating whether exceptions should be raised during execution instead of returning error messages.
· FB_EXEC_SUCCESS: A string constant representing successful execution feedback.
· FB_CODE_NOT_SET: A string constant used when the code is not set in the code dictionary.
· FB_EXECUTION_SUCCEEDED: A string constant for feedback indicating that the execution succeeded without errors.
· FB_OUTPUT_FILE_NOT_FOUND: A string constant for feedback when the expected output file is not found.
· FB_OUTPUT_FILE_FOUND: A string constant for feedback when the expected output file is successfully located.

**Code Description**: The `FactorFBWorkspace` class inherits from `FBWorkspace`. It initializes with an optional flag to raise exceptions. The `hash_func` method generates a hash based on the code in "factor.py" if it exists and exceptions are not being raised, aiding in caching mechanisms. 

The `execute` method orchestrates the process of writing code to a file, linking necessary data files, executing the code, and reading the output factor value from an HDF file. It handles different versions of target tasks by adjusting paths and execution methods accordingly. The method uses a lock to ensure that only one instance is executing at a time in the same workspace path.

Error handling within `execute` includes catching subprocess errors during code execution, timeouts, and issues reading the output file. Depending on the `raise_exception` flag, it either raises exceptions or returns error messages. The caching mechanism stores the function's return value to ensure consistent behavior across multiple calls.

The `__str__` and `__repr__` methods provide string representations of the workspace object, useful for debugging and logging purposes. The static method `from_folder` allows creating an instance of `FactorFBWorkspace` by reading Python files from a specified folder into the code dictionary.

**Note**: Usage points include initializing with or without exception raising, executing the factor implementation, and handling various feedback messages based on execution outcomes. Developers can use this class to manage and execute factor implementations in a structured manner, leveraging caching for efficiency and error handling mechanisms for robustness.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `execute` method could be:
```
('Execution succeeded without error.\nExpected output file found.', 
 DataFrame({'factor_value': [0.123, 0.456, 0.789]}, index=[0, 1, 2]))
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the FactorFBWorkspace class, setting up necessary attributes and configurations.
parameters:
· *args: Variable length argument list passed to the superclass constructor.
· raise_exception: A boolean flag indicating whether exceptions should be raised during operations. Defaults to False.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments passed to the superclass constructor.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that serves as an initializer for new objects of that class. This particular implementation first calls the constructor of its superclass using super().__init__(*args, **kwargs), which allows it to inherit and initialize any attributes or behaviors defined in the parent class with the provided positional (*args) and keyword (**kwargs) arguments.

Following this, the method initializes an instance attribute named raise_exception with the value passed through the raise_exception parameter. This attribute is intended to control whether certain operations within the FactorFBWorkspace should handle errors silently or by raising exceptions, which can be useful for debugging or enforcing strict error handling policies.

Note: When creating a new instance of FactorFBWorkspace, developers can pass any number of positional and keyword arguments that are compatible with the superclass's constructor. Additionally, they can specify whether exceptions should be raised during operations by setting the raise_exception parameter to True. This flexibility allows for customization of behavior based on specific use cases or preferences.
***
### FunctionDef hash_func(self, data_type)
**hash_func**: This function generates a hash value based on the input data type and the content of a specific file stored within an internal dictionary. The hash is computed using the MD5 hashing algorithm.

parameters:
· data_type: A string that specifies the type of data or context for which the hash is being generated. It defaults to "Debug" if no argument is provided.
· self: Implicitly refers to the instance of the class containing this method, which includes an attribute `code_dict` and a boolean attribute `raise_exception`.

Code Description: The function checks if the key "factor.py" exists in the dictionary `self.code_dict` and ensures that `self.raise_exception` is False. If both conditions are met, it concatenates the string value of `data_type` with the content of the file "factor.py" from `self.code_dict`. This concatenated string is then passed to a function named `md5_hash`, which computes and returns its MD5 hash as a hexadecimal string. If either condition fails (i.e., "factor.py" is not in `self.code_dict` or `self.raise_exception` is True), the function returns None.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where a unique identifier for specific data types or contexts related to the content of "factor.py" is required, such as caching mechanisms or integrity checks. The function's behavior can be controlled by setting the appropriate values in `self.code_dict` and `self.raise_exception`.

Output Example: Assuming `data_type` is "Release", `self.code_dict["factor.py"]` contains "def some_function(): pass", and `self.raise_exception` is False, a possible return value could be "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e" (Note: This example hash does not correspond to the actual content provided for illustrative purposes). If any condition fails, the function would return None.
***
### FunctionDef execute(self, data_type)
**execute**: This function executes a factor calculation process by writing necessary code to a workspace directory, linking required data files, running the code, and reading the output factor values from an HDF file.

parameters:
· data_type: A string indicating whether to use debug or production data. Defaults to "Debug".

Code Description: The execute method begins by ensuring that the necessary code is available in the `code_dict` attribute of the class instance. If not, it either raises a `CodeFormatError` or returns an error message based on the `raise_exception` flag.

The function then creates a directory for the workspace and writes the factor calculation code to a file named "factor.py" within this directory. It also links all source data files from a predefined path (either debug or production) into the workspace directory.

Depending on the version of the target task, it either executes the written Python script directly or generates a new Python script from a template that imports and runs the factor calculation code. The generated script is then executed.

The execution process is wrapped in a `FileLock` to prevent concurrent modifications to the workspace directory. If the execution is successful, the function reads the resulting factor values from an HDF file named "result.h5" located in the workspace directory. If any errors occur during execution or reading of the output file, appropriate error messages are generated and returned.

Note: The function includes a caching mechanism that stores the return value to ensure consistent behavior across multiple calls. This cached information includes the execution feedback, the factor values DataFrame, and an optional exception object if an error occurred.

Output Example: ('Execution succeeded and output file found.', DataFrame(...)) where 'DataFrame(...)' represents the pandas DataFrame containing the calculated factor values. If an error occurs during execution or reading of the output file, the first element of the tuple will contain a detailed error message instead of 'Execution succeeded and output file found.'
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: This function provides a human-readable string representation of an instance of the FactorFBWorkspace class. It is typically used to display information about the object in a way that is meaningful to users.

parameters:
· None: The __str__ method does not take any parameters other than the implicit self, which refers to the instance of the class on which the method is called.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function returns a formatted string that includes the factor name associated with the target task and the workspace path. The format of the returned string is "File Factor[factor_name]: workspace_path". It's important to note that if the code cache is operational, the workspace attribute might be None, which would result in the workspace_path being None as well. However, the function does not handle this case explicitly; it simply includes whatever value is stored in self.workspace_path.

Note: Usage points.
This method is automatically invoked when you use the built-in str() function on an instance of FactorFBWorkspace or when you print the object directly (e.g., print(my_factor_workspace_instance)). It's a useful way to get a quick overview of the workspace and its associated factor name without needing to access individual attributes.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
"File Factor[price_prediction]: /home/user/data_science_projects/factor_workspaces/price_prediction"
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: This function provides an official string representation of an instance of the FactorFBWorkspace class. It is used to generate a string that can be used to recreate the object, though in this specific implementation, it simply delegates to the __str__ method for generating a human-readable string.

parameters:
· None: The __repr__ method does not take any parameters other than the implicit self, which refers to the instance of the class on which the method is called.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function returns the result of calling the __str__ method on the same object. This means that when __repr__ is invoked, it will produce a string formatted in the same way as defined in the __str__ method, which includes the factor name associated with the target task and the workspace path. The format of the returned string is "File Factor[factor_name]: workspace_path". If the code cache is operational and the workspace attribute is None, this will be reflected in the output as well.

Note: Usage points.
This method is automatically invoked when you use the built-in repr() function on an instance of FactorFBWorkspace or when you inspect the object in a Python interactive shell. It's particularly useful for developers who need to understand the exact state of an object, although in this case, it behaves identically to __str__ and provides a human-readable summary.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
"File Factor[price_prediction]: /home/user/data_science_projects/factor_workspaces/price_prediction"
***
### FunctionDef from_folder(task, path)
**from_folder**: This function initializes a `FactorFBWorkspace` object by reading Python files from a specified folder path. It constructs a dictionary of file names and their contents, which is then used to populate the workspace with code snippets relevant to the task defined by an instance of `FactorTask`.

parameters:
· task: An instance of `FactorTask` that represents the specific coding task or factor being addressed.
· path: A string or `Path` object indicating the directory from which Python files should be read. This directory is expected to contain `.py` files that will be included in the workspace.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to the `FactorFBWorkspace` constructor, allowing for further customization of the workspace.

Code Description: The function begins by ensuring the path provided is a `Path` object, converting it if necessary. It then initializes an empty dictionary named `code_dict`. This dictionary will store the names and contents of Python files found in the specified directory. The function iterates over each file in the directory using `iterdir()`, checking if the file has a `.py` extension. If so, it reads the file's content using `read_text()` and adds an entry to `code_dict` with the file name as the key and its contents as the value. Finally, the function returns a new instance of `FactorFBWorkspace`, passing in the task, the constructed code dictionary, and any additional keyword arguments provided.

Note: This function is particularly useful for setting up a coding workspace that includes all relevant Python scripts from a specific directory, making it easier to manage and reference multiple files associated with a particular factor or task.

Output Example: Assuming there are two Python files in the specified folder, `script1.py` and `script2.py`, with contents "print('Hello')" and "print('World')", respectively, calling `from_folder` would result in a `FactorFBWorkspace` object initialized with these files. The `code_dict` attribute of this workspace would look like:
```
{
    'script1.py': "print('Hello')",
    'script2.py': "print('World')"
}
```
