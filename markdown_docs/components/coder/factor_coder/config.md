## ClassDef FactorCoSTEERSettings
**FactorCoSTEERSettings**: This class extends CoSTEERSettings and provides specific configuration settings for a factor-based implementation within a financial data processing framework. It includes parameters to define paths, timeouts, selection methods, and execution environments tailored for handling financial factors.

attributes:
· model_config: A configuration dictionary with an environment prefix "FACTOR_CoSTEER_" used to load settings from the environment variables.
· data_folder: Specifies the path to the folder containing the full set of financial data. By default, it points to a directory named "git_ignore_folder/factor_implementation_source_data", which is likely intended for fundamental data in Qlib.
· data_folder_debug: Points to a folder with partial financial data designed for debugging purposes. The default path is "git_ignore_folder/factor_implementation_source_data_debug".
· simple_background: A boolean flag indicating whether the system should use simplified background information when providing code feedback. This can be useful for reducing complexity or focusing on specific aspects of factor implementation.
· file_based_execution_timeout: Defines the maximum time in seconds allowed for each execution of a factor implementation. The default timeout is set to 120 seconds, which provides ample time for complex computations while preventing indefinite execution.
· select_method: Determines the method used for selecting factor implementations. By default, it uses "random" selection, but this can be adjusted based on specific requirements or strategies.
· python_bin: Specifies the path to the Python binary that will be used to execute factor implementations. The default value is simply "python", which assumes that the Python executable is available in the system's PATH.

Code Description: FactorCoSTEERSettings inherits from CoSTEERSettings, indicating it builds upon a base configuration tailored for financial data processing and analysis. It introduces several attributes that are crucial for managing the execution environment of factor implementations, including paths to data sources, timeouts, selection methods, and the Python binary path. These settings are essential for ensuring that the system can efficiently handle large datasets, manage execution times, and provide feedback based on appropriate background information.

Note: When using FactorCoSTEERSettings, developers should ensure that the specified paths for data folders exist and contain the necessary financial data. Additionally, adjusting the file_based_execution_timeout may be necessary depending on the complexity of factor implementations and system performance. The select_method can be customized to implement different strategies for selecting factors, such as based on historical performance or specific criteria.
