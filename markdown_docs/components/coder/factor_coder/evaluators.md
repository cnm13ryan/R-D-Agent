## ClassDef FactorEvaluatorForCoder
**FactorEvaluatorForCoder**: This class serves as a version 1 evaluator specifically designed to assess a single factor implementation within a coding context. It leverages multiple evaluators from shared modules to conduct comprehensive evaluations, focusing on execution feedback, value generation, code quality, and final decision-making.

attributes:
· scen: Represents the scenario or context in which the evaluation is taking place.
· value_evaluator: An instance of FactorValueEvaluator initialized with the scenario, responsible for evaluating the generated factor values.
· code_evaluator: An instance of FactorCodeEvaluator also initialized with the scenario, tasked with assessing the quality and correctness of the implementation's code.
· final_decision_evaluator: An instance of FactorFinalDecisionEvaluator, similarly initialized with the scenario, used to make a final decision based on all previous evaluations.

Code Description: The class inherits from CoSTEEREvaluator. Upon initialization, it sets up three evaluators that will be used throughout its lifecycle. The primary method is `evaluate`, which takes several parameters including the target task, the implementation being evaluated, an optional ground truth implementation, and optionally queried knowledge about previously attempted tasks.

The evaluate method first checks if the provided implementation is None and returns None immediately if so. It then retrieves information about the target task to check against any queried knowledge. If the task has been successfully completed before, it returns the feedback from that previous success. Conversely, if the task has failed too many times, it skips further evaluation and returns a predefined feedback indicating the task should be skipped.

If neither of these conditions is met, the method proceeds with detailed evaluations:
1. It executes the implementation to obtain execution feedback and generated data (gen_df). The execution feedback is cleaned by removing long lists of numbers and warnings.
2. If no factor value is generated (gen_df is None), it skips value evaluation and sets appropriate flags in the feedback object. Otherwise, it uses the `value_evaluator` to assess the values and determine if they meet the criteria.
3. Based on the outcome of the value check, it either skips code evaluation or proceeds with it using the `code_evaluator`. If the value check passes, it assumes no further criticism is needed for the code.
4. Finally, if a decision has not been made based on the value check alone, it uses the `final_decision_evaluator` to make a final judgment considering all feedback gathered so far.

Note: This class is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple evaluations are required to assess different aspects of an implementation comprehensively. It integrates various evaluators to provide detailed and structured feedback, aiding developers in understanding strengths and areas for improvement in their code implementations.

Output Example: A possible return value from the `evaluate` method could be:
```
FactorSingleFeedback(
    execution_feedback="Execution completed successfully without errors.",
    value_generated_flag=True,
    value_feedback="Generated values are within acceptable ranges.",
    code_feedback="Code adheres to best practices and is free of syntax errors.",
    final_decision=True,
    final_feedback="Implementation meets all criteria and is approved.",
    final_decision_based_on_gt=False
)
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the FactorEvaluatorForCoder class, setting up necessary evaluators based on a given scenario.

parameters:
· *args: Variable length argument list that is passed to the superclass constructor.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments that are also passed to the superclass constructor.

Code Description: The __init__ method starts by invoking the constructor of the parent class using super().__init__(*args, **kwargs). This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed. Following this, three specific evaluators are instantiated:
- self.value_evaluator: An instance of FactorValueEvaluator initialized with the scenario (self.scen).
- self.code_evaluator: An instance of FactorCodeEvaluator also initialized with the scenario.
- self.final_decision_evaluator: An instance of FactorFinalDecisionEvaluator, again using the scenario for initialization.

These evaluators are likely responsible for different aspects of evaluating factors related to coding tasks or projects within a specific scenario. The scenario (self.scen) appears to be a crucial component that provides context and data necessary for these evaluations.

Note: When creating an instance of FactorEvaluatorForCoder, ensure that the scenario object is properly defined and passed through *args or **kwargs if required by the parent class constructor. This setup allows the evaluator to make informed decisions based on the provided scenario details.

### FunctionDef evaluate(self, target_task, implementation, gt_implementation, queried_knowledge)
**evaluate**: This function evaluates a given implementation against a target task, optionally using ground truth implementation and queried knowledge to provide feedback on execution, value generation, code quality, and final decision.

**parameters**:
· target_task: An instance of FactorTask that defines the task requirements and specifications.
· implementation: A Workspace object representing the candidate solution or implementation to be evaluated.
· gt_implementation: An optional Workspace object representing the ground truth or correct solution for comparison.
· queried_knowledge: An optional QueriedKnowledge object containing previously gathered knowledge about tasks, which can be used to skip re-evaluation of frequently failing tasks.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that may be required by specific evaluators.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the implementation is None and returns None immediately if true. It then retrieves task information from the target_task object. If queried_knowledge is provided, it checks whether this task has been successfully evaluated before or has failed too many times based on the stored knowledge. In case of a successful previous evaluation, it directly returns the feedback from that evaluation. For tasks that have failed repeatedly, it skips further evaluation and returns a predefined FactorSingleFeedback object indicating the failure.

If queried_knowledge does not provide relevant information about the task's success or failure, the function proceeds with a detailed evaluation process:
1. It executes the implementation and captures the execution feedback and generated data frame (gen_df).
2. The execution feedback is cleaned by removing long lists of numbers and warnings.
3. If gen_df is None, it indicates that no factor value was generated, and the function sets appropriate flags and messages in the FactorSingleFeedback object.
4. Otherwise, it evaluates the generated values against the ground truth (if provided) using a value evaluator to determine if they meet the task's requirements.
5. Based on the outcome of the value evaluation:
   - If the decision from the value check is True, it sets the final decision and feedback accordingly without further code evaluation.
   - If the decision from the value check is False, it evaluates the implementation's code quality using a code evaluator before making a final decision.
6. If no clear decision can be made based on value evaluation alone, both code quality and final decision are evaluated to provide comprehensive feedback.

**Note**: This function is crucial for assessing the correctness, efficiency, and quality of generated implementations in automated coding systems, leveraging previous evaluations when possible to optimize performance.

**Output Example**: 
{
    "execution_feedback": "Execution completed successfully without errors.",
    "value_generated_flag": True,
    "code_feedback": "Code adheres to best practices with minor stylistic improvements suggested.",
    "value_feedback": "Generated values match the expected output within acceptable tolerance.",
    "final_decision": True,
    "final_feedback": "Implementation meets all requirements and is considered successful.",
    "final_decision_based_on_gt": True
}

## FunctionDef shorten_prompt(tpl, render_kwargs, shorten_key, max_trail)
**shorten_prompt**: This function is designed to handle situations where a prompt string (tpl) exceeds a certain length by shortening it in a controlled manner. Instead of indiscriminately truncating the entire prompt, which could lead to loss of important information, this function identifies a specific part of the prompt associated with a given key (shorten_key) and shortens that part to ensure the overall prompt does not exceed a specified maximum length.

**parameters**:
· tpl: A string representing the original template or prompt that may be too long.
· render_kwargs: A dictionary containing keyword arguments used for rendering the prompt. This dictionary should include the key specified by shorten_key whose value needs to be shortened.
· shorten_key: A string indicating which part of the prompt (specifically, which key in the render_kwargs dictionary) should be shortened.
· max_trail: An integer representing the maximum number of characters that can remain after shortening. This parameter defaults to 10.

**Code Description**: The function aims to address the issue of overly long prompts by focusing on a specific section for shortening, thereby preserving the integrity and relevance of other parts of the prompt. It takes in the original template (tpl) and a dictionary of rendering arguments (render_kwargs). Among these arguments, it identifies the value associated with the key specified by shorten_key. The function then proceeds to shorten this particular value while ensuring that the remaining part does not exceed max_trail characters. This approach allows for more nuanced control over prompt length management compared to simple truncation.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where prompts are dynamically generated and may vary in length, such as in chatbots or automated response systems. By using this function, developers can ensure that their prompts remain within acceptable length limits without losing critical information. It is important to ensure that the shorten_key corresponds to a value that can be meaningfully shortened (e.g., a list of items, a long string) and that shortening it will not compromise the functionality or clarity of the prompt.
