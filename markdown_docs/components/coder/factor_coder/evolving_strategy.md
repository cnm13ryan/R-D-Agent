## ClassDef FactorMultiProcessEvolvingStrategy
**FactorMultiProcessEvolvingStrategy**: This class extends `MultiProcessEvolvingStrategy` and is designed to manage the evolving strategy for tasks involving factors, particularly focusing on implementing tasks using multi-processing capabilities. It handles the generation of code implementations based on queried knowledge and manages the evolution process by assigning generated code to sub-tasks.

**attributes**:
· num_loop: An integer attribute initialized to 0, which likely tracks the number of iterations or loops in the evolving strategy.
· haveSelected: A boolean attribute initialized to False, indicating whether a selection has been made during the evolving process.

**Code Description**: The class includes methods for generating error summaries and implementing tasks. The `error_summary` method constructs a summary of errors encountered during task execution by rendering prompts with specific information about the target task and related knowledge. It ensures that the generated prompt does not exceed a predefined token limit by iteratively reducing the amount of included knowledge if necessary.

The `implement_one_task` method is responsible for generating code to implement a given task based on queried knowledge, which includes successful implementations, error-related knowledge, and failed attempts. Similar to the `error_summary` method, it dynamically adjusts the length of the user prompt to stay within the token limit by removing parts of the knowledge if required. The method attempts to generate valid JSON containing the code up to 10 times before returning an empty string if unsuccessful.

The `assign_code_list_to_evo` method assigns a list of generated codes to corresponding sub-tasks in an evolving strategy object (`evo`). It ensures that each sub-task receives its respective code and initializes a workspace for it if one does not already exist. This method facilitates the integration of generated code into the evolving process.

**Note**: Usage points include initializing an instance of `FactorMultiProcessEvolvingStrategy`, calling `implement_one_task` to generate code for specific tasks, and using `assign_code_list_to_evo` to distribute the generated code across sub-tasks in an evolving strategy. Developers should ensure that the necessary knowledge objects (`queried_knowledge`) are correctly populated before invoking these methods.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value from `implement_one_task` could be a string containing Python code, such as:
```
def calculate_factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * calculate_factorial(n-1)
```
If the method fails to generate valid JSON after multiple attempts, it returns an empty string: `""`.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the FactorMultiProcessEvolvingStrategy class.
parameters:
· *args: Variable length argument list passed to the superclass constructor.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments passed to the superclass constructor.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes used for initializing new objects. In this context, it initializes an instance of the FactorMultiProcessEvolvingStrategy class. It first calls the constructor of its superclass using super().__init__(*args, **kwargs), which allows the subclass to inherit and initialize any attributes defined in the parent class with the provided arguments.

Following the call to the superclass constructor, two additional instance variables are initialized:
- num_loop: This variable is set to 0. It likely serves as a counter for tracking the number of iterations or loops performed by the evolving strategy.
- haveSelected: This boolean variable is set to False. It indicates whether a selection process has been carried out in the evolving strategy, possibly related to choosing certain factors or solutions.

Note: When creating an instance of FactorMultiProcessEvolvingStrategy, developers can pass any necessary arguments through *args and **kwargs that are required by the superclass constructor. The num_loop and haveSelected attributes will be initialized as described, ready for use in subsequent methods of the class. This setup is typical in object-oriented programming where a subclass needs to extend or modify the behavior of its parent class while still leveraging the initialization logic provided by the superclass.

### FunctionDef error_summary(self, target_task, queried_former_failed_knowledge_to_render, queried_similar_error_knowledge_to_render)
**error_summary**: Generates a summary of errors encountered during task implementation by rendering system and user prompts using provided knowledge and feedback data.

parameters:
· target_task: An instance of FactorTask representing the current task for which an error summary is being generated.
· queried_former_failed_knowledge_to_render: A list containing previously failed attempts' implementations and feedback, used to provide context about past failures.
· queried_similar_error_knowledge_to_render: A list of similar errors and their corresponding successful knowledge, aiding in understanding the nature of the current issue.

Code Description: The function starts by constructing a system prompt using a template from `implement_prompts` with details such as the scenario description, task information, and feedback from the latest failed attempt. It then iteratively constructs a user prompt that includes similar error knowledge until the combined length of both prompts does not exceed the token limit defined in `LLM_SETTINGS.chat_token_limit`. This is achieved by progressively reducing the amount of included error knowledge if necessary. Once an appropriate prompt length is reached, the function sends these prompts to an API backend for chat completion, which generates a summary of errors based on the provided information.

Note: The function ensures that the generated prompts do not exceed the token limit by dynamically adjusting the content of the user prompt. This is crucial for maintaining efficient and effective communication with the language model used for generating the error summary.

Output Example: "The recent implementation failed due to an incorrect handling of edge cases in the data processing step. Similar errors were encountered when the input format was not validated properly, which led to a TypeError. However, these issues were resolved by adding comprehensive validation checks before processing the data."

This output example illustrates how the function might summarize past failures and similar errors to provide insights into the current task's challenges.

### FunctionDef implement_one_task(self, target_task, queried_knowledge)
**implement_one_task**: This function is designed to implement a specific task by leveraging previously queried knowledge about similar successful and error-prone implementations. It constructs prompts for a language model API, dynamically adjusting their content to stay within token limits, and generates code based on the responses.

parameters:
· target_task: An instance of FactorTask representing the current task that needs to be implemented.
· queried_knowledge: An object containing knowledge about similar tasks, including successful implementations and errors encountered during previous attempts. This can be an instance of CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge or its version 2 (CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV2).

Code Description: The function begins by extracting task information from the target_task parameter. It then retrieves lists of previously successful implementations and errors related to similar tasks from the queried_knowledge object, if available. If the queried_knowledge is an instance of CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV2, it also gathers detailed error knowledge.

A system prompt is constructed using a template with details about the task scenario and feedback from the latest failed attempt. The function then iteratively constructs a user prompt that includes similar successful implementations, errors, and optionally a summary of recent errors until the combined length of both prompts does not exceed the token limit defined in LLM_SETTINGS.chat_token_limit. This is achieved by progressively reducing the amount of included knowledge if necessary.

Once an appropriate prompt length is reached, the function sends these prompts to an API backend for chat completion, which generates code based on the provided information. The function attempts this process up to 10 times, returning the generated code if successful. If all attempts fail, it returns an empty string.

Note: The function ensures that the generated prompts do not exceed the token limit by dynamically adjusting the content of the user prompt. This is crucial for maintaining efficient and effective communication with the language model used for generating the code.

Output Example: "def process_data(data):\n    # Validate input format\n    if not isinstance(data, list):\n        raise TypeError('Input must be a list')\n    \n    # Process data\n    processed_data = [x * 2 for x in data]\n    return processed_data"

This output example illustrates how the function might generate code to process data, including validation checks based on previously encountered errors and successful implementations.
***
### FunctionDef assign_code_list_to_evo(self, code_list, evo)
**assign_code_list_to_evo**: This function assigns a list of code strings to corresponding sub-workspaces within an evolving strategy object, ensuring each workspace is properly initialized if it does not already exist.

parameters:
· code_list: A list of code strings where each string represents the content of a 'factor.py' file intended for a specific sub-task.
· evo: An instance of the evolving strategy class that contains sub-tasks and their associated workspaces.

Code Description: The function iterates over the indices of the sub-tasks within the provided evolving strategy object (evo). For each index, it checks if there is a corresponding code string in the code_list. If the code string is None, the loop continues to the next iteration, skipping any further processing for that index. If the workspace at the current index in evo's sub_workspace_list is also None, a new FactorFBWorkspace object is created with the target_task set to the sub-task at the same index. The newly created or existing workspace then has its inject_code method called with the code string from code_list, effectively injecting the provided code into the workspace.

Note: This function assumes that evo.sub_tasks and evo.sub_workspace_list are lists of equal length and that FactorFBWorkspace is a class capable of handling the injection of code strings. The function modifies the evo object in place and returns it after processing all entries in code_list.

Output Example: Assuming evo initially has two sub-tasks but no workspaces, and code_list contains two valid code strings, the function will create two FactorFBWorkspace objects, inject the respective code strings into them, and return the modified evo object with these new workspaces. If any entry in code_list is None, the corresponding workspace will remain unchanged or uninitialized if it was already None.
