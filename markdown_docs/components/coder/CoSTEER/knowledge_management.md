## ClassDef CoSTEERKnowledge
**CoSTEERKnowledge**: This class represents a specific piece of knowledge within the CoSTEER framework, encapsulating details about a target task, its implementation, and associated feedback.

attributes:
· target_task: An instance of Task representing the specific task for which this knowledge is relevant.
· implementation: A copy of an FBWorkspace object that contains the code or steps used to implement the target task.
· feedback: An instance of Feedback providing information about the outcome or result of the implementation attempt.

Code Description: The CoSTEERKnowledge class is initialized with three parameters: a Task, an FBWorkspace, and a Feedback. It stores these as attributes after making a copy of the implementation to ensure that modifications to the original workspace do not affect stored knowledge. The method get_implementation_and_feedback_str returns a formatted string containing both the implementation code and the feedback details, which can be useful for logging or debugging purposes.

Note: This class is typically used within the CoSTEER framework to store and retrieve information about task implementations and their outcomes. It is instantiated by higher-level components such as CoSTEERRAGStrategyV1 and CoSTEERRAGStrategyV2 during the knowledge generation process, where it captures details of each step in an evolving trace.

Output Example: The output of get_implementation_and_feedback_str might look like this:

------------------implementation code:------------------
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
------------------implementation feedback:------------------
Feedback(execution_feedback='Success', value_generated_flag=True, final_decision=True)
### FunctionDef __init__(self, target_task, implementation, feedback)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the CoSTEERKnowledge class, setting up essential components required for knowledge management within the system.

parameters:
· target_task: Represents the specific task that the knowledge management system is targeting or aiming to support.
· implementation: An instance of FBWorkspace which contains the current state or workspace related to the implementation details of the project or system being managed.
· feedback: An object containing feedback mechanisms or data relevant to the evaluation and improvement of the target task's execution.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __init__ method is a constructor for the CoSTEERKnowledge class. It takes three parameters: target_task, implementation, and feedback. These parameters are crucial as they define the context within which the knowledge management system operates. The method assigns the provided target_task to an instance variable self.target_task, thus establishing what task the system is focused on. For the implementation parameter, a copy of the FBWorkspace object is made using the .copy() method and assigned to self.implementation. This ensures that any modifications to the workspace within this class do not affect the original workspace outside of it, maintaining data integrity. Lastly, the feedback parameter is directly assigned to self.feedback, allowing the system to utilize feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.

Note: Usage points.
When creating an instance of CoSTEERKnowledge, developers must provide a Task object representing the target task, an FBWorkspace object encapsulating the current implementation details, and a Feedback object that includes necessary feedback data or mechanisms. This setup is essential for initializing the knowledge management system with all required components to function effectively in its designated context.
***
### FunctionDef get_implementation_and_feedback_str(self)
**get_implementation_and_feedback_str**: This function returns a formatted string containing implementation code and associated feedback.
parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The method does not accept any external parameters; it operates on the instance's attributes.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function `get_implementation_and_feedback_str` is designed to concatenate and format two pieces of information related to an implementation: the actual code and the feedback received about that code. It uses Python's formatted string literals (f-strings) for this purpose. The method accesses two attributes of its class instance, `self.implementation.code` and `self.feedback`, to retrieve the necessary data.

The `self.implementation.code` attribute is expected to hold a string representing the source code or some form of implementation details. This could be any kind of text that describes how something was implemented, such as a piece of programming code, pseudocode, or even plain English instructions.

The `self.feedback` attribute is also expected to be a string (or an object with a meaningful string representation due to the use of `!s`, which calls the `str()` function on it) that contains feedback related to the implementation. This feedback could include comments, suggestions for improvement, or any other form of commentary about the implementation.

The function returns a single string where these two pieces of information are separated by a delimiter line. The delimiter is designed to clearly distinguish between the code and its feedback, making the output easy to read and understand.

Note: Usage points.
This method is particularly useful in scenarios where developers need to document their work alongside any comments or critiques received from peers or supervisors. It can be part of a larger system for managing knowledge and reviews within a development team.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
------------------implementation code:------------------
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
------------------implementation feedback:------------------
The function is correct but could benefit from type hints for better readability and maintainability.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, success_task_to_knowledge_dict, failed_task_info_set)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge class, setting up dictionaries and sets to manage knowledge from successful tasks and information about failed tasks.

parameters:
· success_task_to_knowledge_dict: A dictionary mapping task identifiers (keys) to their corresponding knowledge or results (values). Defaults to an empty dictionary if no argument is provided.
· failed_task_info_set: A set containing information about tasks that have failed. Each element in the set represents a unique piece of failure information. Defaults to an empty set if no argument is provided.

Code Description: The __init__ method is the constructor for the CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge class. It accepts two parameters, both with default values allowing instantiation without arguments. The first parameter, success_task_to_knowledge_dict, is expected to be a dictionary where each key-value pair represents a task that has been successfully executed and its associated knowledge or result. This could include data like the output of a computation, a summary of findings, or any other relevant information produced by the task.

The second parameter, failed_task_info_set, is intended to hold information about tasks that have not completed successfully. This set can store various types of failure details such as error messages, stack traces, or identifiers for troubleshooting purposes. By using a set, it ensures that each piece of failure information is unique and avoids duplicates.

Upon initialization, the method assigns these parameters to instance variables self.success_task_to_knowledge_dict and self.failed_task_info_set respectively. This setup allows other methods within the class to access and manipulate this data as needed for knowledge management tasks.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge with predefined dictionaries and sets, or initializing it without arguments to start with empty structures that can be populated later in the program's execution. Proper handling of these data structures is crucial for effective knowledge management within the application.
***
## ClassDef CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1
**CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1**: This class represents a version 1 implementation of an evolving knowledge base specifically designed within the CoSTEER framework. It extends from a more general EvolvingKnowledgeBase class, likely providing specialized functionalities tailored to the needs of CoSTEER.

attributes:
· path: A string or Path object that specifies the location where the knowledge base data is stored. This parameter is optional and defaults to None if not provided.

Code Description: The CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1 class initializes with an optional path parameter, which it passes to its superclass constructor. It maintains two primary attributes: `implementation_trace` and `success_task_info_set`. The `implementation_trace` attribute is a dictionary that maps strings (likely task identifiers) to instances of `CoSTEERKnowledge`, presumably storing detailed knowledge related to specific tasks or implementations. The `success_task_info_set` is a set used to store information about successfully completed tasks, ensuring uniqueness and quick lookup capabilities.

The class also includes an empty method `query()`, which is intended to retrieve queried knowledge from the knowledge base using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy. However, this method currently raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that its implementation is pending or has not yet been defined in this version of the class.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1 with a specified path to load existing knowledge base data or without any path if starting from scratch. This knowledge base can then be utilized by other components, such as `CoSTEERRAGStrategyV1`, which requires an instance of CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1 during its initialization. The query method is expected to be implemented in future versions to allow for querying the stored knowledge using a RAG strategy.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1, setting up internal data structures to manage task implementations and their associated knowledge.

parameters:
· path: A string or Path object representing the file system path where knowledge data might be stored or retrieved. This parameter is optional and defaults to None if not provided.

Code Description: The __init__ method performs several key initializations. It sets up an internal dictionary named `implementation_trace` to store instances of CoSTEERKnowledge, keyed by a string identifier for each task. This dictionary will hold detailed information about the implementation of tasks, including their code and feedback outcomes. Another set named `success_task_info_set` is initialized to keep track of identifiers of tasks that have been successfully implemented.

The method also initializes an empty dictionary `task_to_embedding`, which could be used in future implementations for mapping task identifiers to embeddings or other representations. Finally, the method calls the superclass's __init__ method with the provided path parameter, allowing any additional initialization logic defined in the parent class to execute.

Note: This constructor is crucial for setting up the initial state of a CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1 instance, preparing it to store and manage knowledge about task implementations. Developers should ensure that the path parameter points to a valid location if they intend to persist or retrieve data from the file system. Beginners might find it helpful to understand how this class integrates with other components in the CoSTEER framework, particularly how instances of CoSTEERKnowledge are stored and utilized within `implementation_trace`.
***
### FunctionDef query(self)
**query**: This function is designed to query the knowledge base and retrieve queried knowledge using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy. Currently, this functionality is not implemented and will raise a `NotImplementedError` when called.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `query` method is part of the `CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1` class. Its purpose is to interact with the knowledge base to fetch relevant information based on a query, utilizing a RAG strategy. However, as indicated by the `raise NotImplementedError`, this functionality has not yet been implemented in the current version of the code. When invoked, it will terminate execution and notify the caller that the method is not available.

Note: Developers should be aware that calling this function at present will result in an error. Implementation details for querying the knowledge base using RAG are pending and should be considered when integrating or extending this component. Beginners are advised to check for updates or alternative methods provided by the project documentation for accessing knowledge from the knowledge base.
***
## ClassDef CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV1
**CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV1**: This class extends CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge to manage queried knowledge by storing information about failed task traces and successful knowledge from similar tasks.

**attributes**:
· task_to_former_failed_traces: A dictionary mapping task identifiers to lists of their previously failed execution traces.
· task_to_similar_task_successful_knowledge: A dictionary mapping task identifiers to lists of successful knowledge (implementation traces) from similar tasks.

**Code Description**: The CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV1 class initializes with two dictionaries. `task_to_former_failed_traces` captures the historical failures for specific tasks, which can be useful for debugging and understanding why certain tasks fail repeatedly. On the other hand, `task_to_similar_task_successful_knowledge` stores successful implementation traces from tasks that are similar to the current task. This information can be leveraged to inform or guide the execution of the current task by providing examples of how similar tasks were successfully completed.

The class inherits from CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge, which already manages success and failure data for tasks through `success_task_to_knowledge_dict` and `failed_task_info_set`. By extending this base class, CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV1 adds more granular information about failed traces and successful knowledge from similar tasks.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where detailed historical data on task failures and successes are required for advanced querying or decision-making processes. This class is particularly useful in systems that need to learn from past experiences and apply that learning to new, but related, tasks. Developers can utilize this class to enhance the robustness and adaptability of their applications by incorporating a deeper understanding of both successful and failed execution paths. Beginners should be aware that this class builds upon the foundational knowledge management provided by CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge, so familiarity with its attributes and methods is beneficial.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV1 class, setting up dictionaries to store information about failed traces for specific tasks and successful knowledge from similar tasks.

parameters:
· *args: Variable length argument list that can be passed to the parent class's initializer.
· task_to_former_failed_traces: A dictionary mapping tasks to their previously encountered failed execution traces. Defaults to an empty dictionary if not provided.
· task_to_similar_task_successful_knowledge: A dictionary mapping tasks to successful knowledge from similar tasks. Defaults to an empty dictionary if not provided.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments that can be passed to the parent class's initializer.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor for the CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV1 class. It accepts both positional and keyword arguments, which are then forwarded to the superclass's initializer using super().__init__(*args, **kwargs). This allows the subclass to inherit initialization behavior from its parent class while adding or modifying specific attributes.

The method initializes two instance variables:
- task_to_former_failed_traces: This dictionary is intended to keep track of failed execution traces for different tasks. It can be used to understand why certain tasks have failed in the past, which might help in diagnosing issues or improving future executions.
- task_to_similar_task_successful_knowledge: This dictionary stores successful knowledge from similar tasks. This can be useful for leveraging previously learned information to enhance performance on new but related tasks.

The use of default empty dictionaries ensures that these attributes are always initialized, even if no specific data is provided during object creation.

Note: When creating an instance of CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV1, developers can pass additional arguments through *args and **kwargs if the parent class requires them for its initialization. This flexibility allows the subclass to integrate seamlessly with a broader system or framework that might have specific requirements for object initialization.
***
## ClassDef CoSTEERRAGStrategyV1
**CoSTEERRAGStrategyV1**: This class represents a strategy version 1 for retrieving and generating knowledge using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. It inherits from `RAGStrategy` and is designed to interact with a specific type of knowledge base (`CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1`) and settings (`CoSTEERSettings`). The primary methods in this class are intended for generating knowledge based on evolving traces and querying the knowledge base, although both methods are currently marked as not implemented.

**attributes**:
· `knowledgebase`: An instance of `CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1` that serves as the storage for knowledge.
· `current_generated_trace_count`: A counter to keep track of how many traces have been processed so far. This helps in determining which parts of the evolving trace need to be processed next.
· `settings`: An instance of `CoSTEERSettings` that contains configuration parameters used by the strategy, such as limits for querying former traces and similar successful tasks.

**Code Description**: The class defines an initializer (`__init__`) that sets up the knowledge base and settings. It also initializes a counter to track processed traces. Two main methods are defined: `generate_knowledge` and `query`. 

The `generate_knowledge` method is intended to process new entries in the evolving trace, extract relevant information from each step (such as tasks, implementations, and feedback), and store this knowledge in the knowledge base if it hasn't been stored before. However, this method raises a `NotImplementedError`, indicating that its functionality should not be used and users are encouraged to use version 2 of the strategy.

The `query` method is designed to retrieve relevant knowledge from the knowledge base based on the current state of evolving subjects and the evolving trace. It checks if tasks have been successfully completed before, limits the number of former failed traces considered, and finds similar successful tasks based on embedding distances. Similar to `generate_knowledge`, this method also raises a `NotImplementedError` for the same reason.

**Note**: The methods in this class are not implemented and should not be used directly. Users are advised to use version 2 of the strategy (`CoSTEERRAGStrategyV2`) instead, which presumably contains the full implementation of these functionalities.

**Output Example**: Since both methods raise a `NotImplementedError`, they do not return any values under normal circumstances. If implemented, an example output for `generate_knowledge` might be `None` if no new knowledge is generated or stored, and for `query`, it could be an instance of `CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV1` containing dictionaries of successful tasks, failed task information, former failed traces, and similar successful knowledge.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, knowledgebase, settings)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of CoSTEERRAGStrategyV1 with a specified knowledge base and settings.

parameters:
· knowledgebase: An instance of CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1, representing the version 1 implementation of an evolving knowledge base designed within the CoSTEER framework.
· settings: An instance of CoSTEERSettings, which contains configuration settings relevant to the operation of CoSTEERRAGStrategyV1.

Code Description: The __init__ method begins by calling the superclass's initializer with the provided knowledgebase parameter. This setup ensures that any initialization logic defined in the superclass is executed. Following this, it initializes an attribute `current_generated_trace_count` to 0, which likely keeps track of the number of generated traces or queries made during the operation of CoSTEERRAGStrategyV1. Additionally, it assigns the provided settings parameter to an instance variable named `settings`, making these configuration options accessible throughout the lifecycle of the CoSTEERRAGStrategyV1 object.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of CoSTEERRAGStrategyV1 by providing a pre-existing or newly created CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV1 and appropriate settings. This setup is essential for leveraging the knowledge stored in the knowledge base and applying the specified configurations to guide the behavior of the strategy during its operation.
***
### FunctionDef generate_knowledge(self, evolving_trace)
**generate_knowledge**: This function is designed to generate knowledge from an evolving trace of task implementations and their feedbacks within the CoSTEER framework. It processes each step in the evolving trace, extracts relevant information about tasks, their implementations, and associated feedback, and stores this information as instances of `CoSTEERKnowledge` in a knowledgebase.

**parameters**:
· evolving_trace: A list of `EvoStep` objects representing the sequence of task evolution steps. Each `EvoStep` contains details about the evolvable subjects (tasks and their implementations) and feedback received for each implementation attempt.
· return_knowledge: A boolean flag indicating whether the function should return the generated knowledge. The default value is False, meaning the function will not return anything unless explicitly specified.

**Code Description**: The function starts by checking if the length of `evolving_trace` matches `current_generated_trace_count`, which indicates that no new steps need processing. If there are new steps, it iterates over them starting from `current_generated_trace_count`. For each step, it retrieves the implementations and feedback associated with the tasks in that step.

The function then iterates through each task within a step, extracting information about the task, its implementation, and the specific feedback received for that task. If the feedback is None (indicating no feedback was provided), the function skips to the next task.

For each valid task-feedback pair, it creates an instance of `CoSTEERKnowledge` encapsulating the target task, its implementation, and the feedback. This knowledge object is then added to a dictionary in the knowledgebase under the key corresponding to the task information, if that information is not already marked as successful in another set within the knowledgebase.

If the feedback indicates a final decision of True (meaning the task was successfully completed), the task information is added to the set of successful tasks. After processing all new steps, `current_generated_trace_count` is updated to reflect the number of processed steps.

**Note**: This function is currently marked as not implemented and encourages users to use version 2 instead. Despite this, understanding its intended functionality can be useful for developers working within or extending the CoSTEER framework.

**Output Example**: Since the function does not return anything by default (`return_knowledge` is False), there is no direct output in that case. However, if `return_knowledge` were set to True, the function would need to be modified to return a list of `CoSTEERKnowledge` objects representing the newly generated knowledge. Here's an example of what such a return value might look like:

[
    CoSTEERKnowledge(
        target_task=Task(...),
        implementation=FBWorkspace(...),
        feedback=Feedback(execution_feedback='Success', value_generated_flag=True, final_decision=True)
    ),
    CoSTEERKnowledge(
        target_task=Task(...),
        implementation=FBWorkspace(...),
        feedback=Feedback(execution_feedback='Failure', value_generated_flag=False, final_decision=False)
    )
]
***
### FunctionDef query(self, evo, evolving_trace)
**query**: This function queries the knowledge base to gather relevant information about tasks based on their success or failure history. It is designed to return queried knowledge specific to the given evolvable subjects and their evolving trace, but it currently raises a `NotImplementedError` as version 2 of this method is recommended for use.

parameters:
· evo: An instance of EvolvableSubjects representing the subject tasks that are being evolved or modified.
· evolving_trace: A list of EvoStep objects that represent the steps taken during the evolution process of the tasks.

Code Description: The function aims to return an object of type `CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge` containing queried knowledge about the provided tasks. It checks if each task's information is in the set of successful tasks within the knowledge base. If it is, it adds the last implementation trace for that task to a dictionary mapping successful tasks to their knowledge. If the task has failed more times than the specified limit (`fail_task_trial_limit`), it adds the task information to a set of failed tasks. Otherwise, it collects the most recent failed traces up to `v1_query_former_trace_limit` and finds similar successful tasks based on embedding distance, storing the last implementation trace of these similar tasks.

The function uses settings such as `v1_query_former_trace_limit`, `v1_query_similar_success_limit`, and `fail_task_trial_limit` to control how much historical data is considered when querying the knowledge base. It leverages a helper function `calculate_embedding_distance_between_str_list` to determine similarity between task descriptions.

Note: This method is currently not implemented and raises an error, encouraging users to use version 2 instead. Developers should ensure they are using the correct version of the query method for their application needs. Beginners should be aware that this function builds upon a knowledge management system that tracks both successful and failed tasks, so understanding the underlying data structures (`CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge`, `CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV1`) is beneficial.

Output Example: Although the current implementation raises an error, if it were functional, the output might look like this:

{
    "success_task_to_knowledge_dict": {
        "task_info_1": ["trace_1", "trace_2"],
        "task_info_3": ["trace_4"]
    },
    "failed_task_info_set": {"task_info_2"},
    "task_to_former_failed_traces": {
        "task_info_2": ["failed_trace_1", "failed_trace_2"]
    },
    "task_to_similar_task_successful_knowledge": {
        "task_info_2": [["trace_4"], ["trace_5"]]
    }
}

### FunctionDef __init__(self, task_to_former_failed_traces, task_to_similar_task_successful_knowledge, task_to_similar_error_successful_knowledge)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV2 class, setting up internal dictionaries to manage knowledge related to task failures and successes.

parameters:
· task_to_former_failed_traces: A dictionary mapping tasks to their previously encountered failed execution traces.
· task_to_similar_task_successful_knowledge: A dictionary mapping tasks to successful knowledge from similar tasks.
· task_to_similar_error_successful_knowledge: A dictionary mapping tasks to successful knowledge that resolved similar errors.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to the superclass constructor.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor for the CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV2 class. It initializes the instance with three primary dictionaries:
- task_to_similar_error_successful_knowledge, which stores successful knowledge from resolving similar errors.
- task_to_former_failed_traces and task_to_similar_task_successful_knowledge are passed to the superclass's constructor using super().__init__(). This suggests that CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV2 inherits from another class, likely handling additional initialization or functionality related to these dictionaries.

The method ensures that each instance of CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV2 is equipped with a structured way to store and potentially retrieve knowledge about task failures and successes. The use of **kwargs allows for flexibility in passing additional parameters that might be required by the superclass, making the class adaptable to various contexts or extensions.

Note: When creating an instance of CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV2, developers can provide initial dictionaries for task_to_former_failed_traces and task_to_similar_task_successful_knowledge. The task_to_similar_error_successful_knowledge dictionary is directly assigned within this constructor, indicating it might be used differently or more specifically by methods in the CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV2 class itself. Developers should ensure that the dictionaries provided are structured correctly to match expected formats for optimal functionality.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, knowledgebase, settings)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the CoSTEERRAGStrategyV2 class by setting up its knowledgebase and configuration settings.

parameters:
· knowledgebase: An instance of CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV2 that provides the foundational data and information for the strategy.
· settings: An instance of CoSTEERSettings that contains various configuration parameters necessary for the operation of the strategy.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor in Python, responsible for initializing new objects. In this context, it sets up an object of the CoSTEERRAGStrategyV2 class with two primary attributes: knowledgebase and settings. By calling super().__init__(knowledgebase), it ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class (which could be part of a larger inheritance hierarchy) is executed first. This is crucial for maintaining proper functionality if the class inherits from another class.

The method also initializes an attribute named current_generated_trace_count to 0, which likely serves as a counter to keep track of how many traces or sequences have been generated by this strategy instance. The settings parameter is directly assigned to self.settings, making it accessible throughout the lifecycle of the object for any configuration-related queries or adjustments.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that valid instances of CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV2 and CoSTEERSettings are provided when creating an instance of CoSTEERRAGStrategyV2. This setup allows the strategy to operate with a predefined set of data and configurations, facilitating its intended functionality within the application.

### FunctionDef generate_knowledge(self, evolving_trace)
**generate_knowledge**: This function processes an evolving trace of task implementations and feedback to generate knowledge that can be stored in a knowledge base. It iterates through each step in the evolving trace, extracts relevant information about tasks, their implementations, and associated feedback, and creates instances of CoSTEERKnowledge objects for successful tasks or error analysis results for failed ones.

**parameters**:
· evolving_trace: A list of EvoStep objects representing the sequence of task implementations and their outcomes.
· return_knowledge: A boolean flag indicating whether to return knowledge. Currently, this parameter is not utilized in the function implementation and always returns None.

**Code Description**: The function first checks if the length of the evolving trace matches the current count of generated traces (`self.current_generated_trace_count`). If they match, it means no new knowledge needs to be generated, and the function returns None. Otherwise, it proceeds to iterate over each EvoStep in the evolving trace starting from `current_generated_trace_count`. For each step, it retrieves the implementations and feedback associated with the step.

The function then iterates through each sub-task within the implementations. It extracts task information, implementation details, and corresponding feedback for each sub-task. If either the implementation or feedback is missing (None), the loop continues to the next sub-task. Otherwise, a CoSTEERKnowledge object is created encapsulating the target task, its implementation, and the feedback.

The function checks if the task information is not already present in the success dictionary of the knowledge base (`self.knowledgebase.success_task_to_knowledge_dict`). If it's not present and the implementation is available, the new knowledge is added to the working trace knowledge list. If the feedback indicates a successful final decision (`single_feedback.final_decision == True`), the knowledge is also stored in the success dictionary, and the knowledge graph is updated with this success information.

If the task was not successful, the function performs an error analysis on the feedback using the `analyze_error` method. Depending on whether the issue was during execution or value checking, it generates a list of errors. These errors are then added to the working trace error analysis list in the knowledge base for further processing and graph updates.

After processing all steps in the evolving trace, the function updates `self.current_generated_trace_count` to reflect the number of processed traces and returns None.

**Note**: The function is designed to be part of a larger system where task implementations and feedback are continuously monitored and used to build a knowledge base. It assumes that certain attributes and methods (like `knowledgebase`, `analyze_error`, etc.) are available in the class instance (`self`).

**Output Example**: Since the function always returns None, there is no direct output value. However, as a side effect of calling this function, new entries may be added to the knowledge base's working trace and success dictionaries, or error analysis lists. For example, if a task was successfully implemented, an entry might be added to `self.knowledgebase.success_task_to_knowledge_dict` with the task information as the key and a CoSTEERKnowledge object as the value. If there were errors, they would be stored in `self.knowledgebase.working_trace_error_analysis`.

### FunctionDef analyze_component(self, target_task_information)
**analyze_component**: This function analyzes a given target task to identify relevant component nodes from a knowledgebase graph. It constructs a system prompt using predefined templates and the content of all component nodes, then sends this along with the target task information to an API for analysis. The response is expected to be a list of indices corresponding to the identified components, which are then mapped back to their respective node objects.

**parameters**:
· target_task_information: A string that contains details about the target task to be analyzed.

**Code Description**: The function starts by retrieving all nodes labeled as "component" from the knowledgebase graph. If no such nodes exist, it returns an empty list. It then concatenates the content of these component nodes into a single string. This string is used in conjunction with a system prompt template to form a complete system prompt for analysis.

The target task information serves as the user prompt. The function sends both prompts to an API backend that performs the analysis and returns a JSON response containing a list of indices ("component_no_list"). These indices correspond to the relevant component nodes identified by the analysis. The function maps these indices back to their respective node objects, ensuring no duplicates and sorting them in ascending order.

In case of any errors during this process, such as an invalid response format from the API, the function logs a warning and returns an empty list.

**Note**: This function is crucial for identifying relevant components related to a specific task, which can be used for further knowledge querying and retrieval processes. It relies on the accuracy and completeness of the component nodes in the knowledgebase graph as well as the effectiveness of the API's analysis capabilities.

**Output Example**: A possible return value could be a list of `UndirectedNode` objects representing the relevant components identified by the analysis:
[
    UndirectedNode(id=1, label='component', content='Component 1 description'),
    UndirectedNode(id=3, label='component', content='Component 3 description')
]
***
### FunctionDef analyze_error(self, single_feedback, feedback_type)
**analyze_error**: This function analyzes error feedback from a given task execution or value check to identify specific errors and match them against known errors stored in the knowledge base.

parameters:
· single_feedback: A string containing the feedback information about an error, which can be either from an execution failure or a value mismatch.
· feedback_type: A string indicating the type of feedback. It can be "execution" for errors during code execution or "value" for discrepancies between expected and actual values in data frames.

Code Description: The function begins by checking the type of feedback provided. If it is an "execution" error, it uses a regular expression to parse out details such as the file name, line number, function name, problematic line of code, error type, and error message from the feedback string. These details are then formatted into a list containing the error type and the erroneous line.

For "value" errors, which typically arise from data frame comparisons, it searches for specific predefined patterns in the feedback string that indicate different types of mismatches or issues. It compiles all matching patterns into a list.

Next, the function retrieves all nodes labeled as "error" from the knowledge base graph. If no such nodes exist, it returns the list of error contents directly. Otherwise, it iterates over each identified error content and compares it against the known error nodes in the knowledge base. If an exact match is found, the corresponding node is added to the result list; otherwise, the original error content string is included.

The function ensures that no duplicate entries are added to the final list of errors by checking if the last appended item already exists in the preceding elements of the list and removing it if necessary.

Note: This function is crucial for identifying and categorizing errors encountered during task execution or data validation, facilitating the retrieval of relevant knowledge from the knowledge base to assist in debugging and error resolution.

Output Example: 
For an "execution" feedback string like 'File "script.py", line 10, in main\n    result = x / y\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero', the function might return ['ErrorType: ZeroDivisionError\nError line:     result = x / y'].
For a "value" feedback string indicating a row count mismatch, it could return ['The source dataframe and the ground truth dataframe have different rows count.'].
If no known error nodes match the identified errors, the output will include the original error content strings.
***
### FunctionDef former_trace_query(self, evo, queried_knowledge_v2, v2_query_former_trace_limit, v2_add_fail_attempt_to_latest_successful_execution)
**former_trace_query**: This function queries the former trace knowledge of the working trace to find all failed task information where the number of attempts exceeds a specified limit.

parameters:
· evo: An instance of EvolvableSubjects, representing the evolving subjects or tasks being processed.
· queried_knowledge_v2: An instance of CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV2, which accumulates knowledge about tasks and their outcomes.
· v2_query_former_trace_limit: An integer specifying the maximum number of former failed traces to include in the query results. Default is 5.
· v2_add_fail_attempt_to_latest_successful_execution: A boolean flag indicating whether to add the latest failed attempt to the latest successful execution if applicable. Default is False.

Code Description: The function iterates over each sub-task within the EvolvableSubjects object (evo). For each task, it checks if the task information is not in the success dictionary but exists in the working trace knowledge and has been attempted more times than the fail_task_trial_limit. If so, it adds this task to the failed task info set of queried_knowledge_v2.

Next, for tasks that are neither successful nor already identified as failed, it copies the former trace knowledge related to these tasks from the working trace knowledge. It then filters out traces where a successful attempt (value_generated_flag is True) is immediately followed by an unsuccessful one (value_generated_flag is False), assuming this indicates a deterioration in performance.

If v2_add_fail_attempt_to_latest_successful_execution is set to True, and there are more attempts than just the latest successful execution, it identifies the latest failed attempt. This information is then stored in queried_knowledge_v2 along with the last few failed traces up to the limit specified by v2_query_former_trace_limit.

Note: This function is crucial for identifying recurring failures and understanding patterns of task execution, which can be used to improve future attempts or avoid similar pitfalls.

Output Example: 
{
    'task_to_former_failed_traces': {
        'Task1': ([Trace3, Trace4], Trace5),
        'Task2': ([Trace7], None)
    },
    'failed_task_info_set': {'Task1', 'Task2'}
}
In this example, Task1 has two former failed traces (Trace3 and Trace4) with the latest failed attempt being Trace5. Task2 has one former failed trace (Trace7), and no additional latest failed attempt is recorded. Both tasks are also listed in the failed_task_info_set.
***
### FunctionDef component_query(self, evo, queried_knowledge_v2, v2_query_component_limit, knowledge_sampler)
Doc is waiting to be generated...
***
### FunctionDef error_query(self, evo, queried_knowledge_v2, v2_query_error_limit, knowledge_sampler)
**error_query**: This function processes a set of evolvable subjects to identify and gather knowledge related to errors encountered during task execution. It updates the queried knowledge object by adding information about similar tasks that have successfully resolved these errors.

**parameters**:
· evo: An instance of EvolvableSubjects, representing the evolving tasks or subjects being processed.
· queried_knowledge_v2: An instance of CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV2, which holds the accumulated knowledge and will be updated with error-related information.
· v2_query_error_limit: An integer specifying the maximum number of error-related successful knowledge pairs to retrieve for each task. The default value is 5.
· knowledge_sampler: A float representing the probability of including a retrieved knowledge pair in the final result. This acts as a sampling rate, where values closer to 1 include more pairs. The default value is 1.0.

**Code Description**: The function iterates over each task within the EvolvableSubjects object. For each task, it checks if the task information exists in either the success_task_to_knowledge_dict or failed_task_info_set of the queried knowledge object. If not, it proceeds to gather error-related successful knowledge pairs. It does this by examining former failed traces associated with the task and identifying similar tasks that have successfully resolved errors encountered in these traces. The function then limits the number of retrieved knowledge pairs based on v2_query_error_limit and applies a sampling rate defined by knowledge_sampler before updating the queried_knowledge_v2 object.

**Note**: This function is typically called as part of a larger querying process, such as within the query method of CoSTEERRAGStrategyV2. It plays a crucial role in accumulating error-resolution knowledge, which can be used to improve future task executions.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be an instance of CoSTEERQueriedKnowledgeV2 with updated task_to_similar_error_successful_knowledge attribute. For example:

```
{
    "task_to_former_failed_traces": {...},
    "task_to_similar_task_successful_knowledge": {...},
    "task_to_similar_error_successful_knowledge": {
        "task1": [
            ("error_description_1", "successful_resolution_1"),
            ("error_description_2", "successful_resolution_2")
        ],
        "task2": [
            ("error_description_3", "successful_resolution_3")
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example, task1 has two error-related successful knowledge pairs, while task2 has one. Each pair consists of an error description and the corresponding successful resolution strategy.
***
## ClassDef CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV2
**CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV2**: This class represents an advanced knowledge management system designed to evolve over time by integrating new information and learning from successful tasks. It extends the functionality of an `EvolvingKnowledgeBase` and utilizes a graph-based structure to store and query knowledge.

**attributes**:
· init_component_list: An optional list of initial components to be added to the knowledge base.
· path: An optional string or Path object specifying the location where the graph data is stored. Defaults to the current working directory with the filename "graph.pkl".

**Code Description**: The `CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV2` class initializes a knowledge graph using an undirected graph structure, which is loaded from a file specified by the `path` parameter or defaults to a predefined location. If an initial component list is provided, it adds these components as nodes in the graph with the label "component". The class maintains several dictionaries to track working traces of tasks, error analyses, successful tasks, and implementations associated with specific nodes.

The `get_all_nodes_by_label` method retrieves all nodes from the graph that match a specified label. This is useful for filtering nodes based on their type or role within the knowledge base.

The `update_success_task` method processes information about successfully completed tasks by transferring their working traces and error analyses into the knowledge storage and graph structure. It creates new nodes for task descriptions, task traces, and successful implementations, linking them appropriately in the graph. This method ensures that the knowledge base evolves with each successful task, incorporating valuable insights and outcomes.

The `query` method is currently a placeholder and does not perform any specific action. It suggests that future versions of this class might include more sophisticated querying capabilities.

Several methods are provided for querying the graph based on different criteria:
- `graph_get_node_by_content`: Retrieves a node from the graph by its content.
- `graph_query_by_content`: Searches the graph for nodes whose content matches specified criteria, including similarity thresholds and connection relationships. It returns a list of matching nodes or an empty list if no suitable nodes are found.
- `graph_query_by_node`: Similar to `graph_query_by_content`, but starts the search from a specific node rather than using content as a starting point.
- `graph_query_by_intersection`: Finds nodes that are intersections of multiple input nodes, considering specified constraints. It can also return the original nodes responsible for each intersection if requested.

**Note**: The knowledge base is designed to be dynamic and expandable, allowing it to adapt to new information and learn from past successes. Developers should ensure that the graph file exists at the specified path or provide a valid alternative location during initialization.

**Output Example**: When calling `get_all_nodes_by_label("component")`, the method might return a list of nodes like this:
```
[
    UndirectedNode(content='ComponentA', label='component'),
    UndirectedNode(content='ComponentB', label='component'),
    UndirectedNode(content='ComponentC', label='component')
]
```

When using `graph_query_by_content("example_task", topk_k=3)`, the output could be:
```
[
    UndirectedNode(content='Example Task 1', label='task_description'),
    UndirectedNode(content='Example Task 2', label='task_description'),
    UndirectedNode(content='Related Component X', label='component')
]
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, init_component_list, path)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV2, setting up a knowledge graph and initializing various dictionaries to manage task traces, error analyses, successful tasks, and node-to-knowledge mappings.

**parameters**:
· init_component_list: An optional list of components to be added to the knowledge graph. If provided, each component is checked for existence in the graph; if it does not exist, a new node labeled "component" is created.
· path: An optional string or Path object specifying the location of the graph file. Defaults to the current working directory with the filename "graph.pkl".

**Code Description**: The constructor begins by initializing an UndirectedGraph instance using a specified path for the graph file, defaulting to "graph.pkl" in the current working directory if no path is provided. It logs the size of the loaded knowledge graph.

If an `init_component_list` is supplied, the function iterates over each component in the list. For each component, it checks whether a node with that content already exists in the graph. If such a node does not exist, a new UndirectedNode is created with the component as its content and labeled "component". This new node is then added to the graph without any neighbors.

Several dictionaries are initialized to manage different aspects of task handling:
- `working_trace_knowledge`: Stores all working traces until they either fail or succeed.
- `working_trace_error_analysis`: Contains error analyses for each step, aligned with the corresponding working trace.
- `success_task_to_knowledge_dict`: Holds information about tasks that have successfully completed.
- `node_to_implementation_knowledge_dict`: Maps node IDs (related to task traces and successful implementations) to knowledge instances of type 'CoSTEERKnowledge'.
- `task_to_component_nodes`: Stores mappings from task descriptions to component nodes, facilitating quick access to relevant components for specific tasks.

**Note**: When initializing an instance of CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV2, developers can optionally provide a list of initial components and specify the path to the graph file. This setup is crucial for managing knowledge effectively within the system, allowing for dynamic updates and retrievals based on task progress and outcomes.
***
### FunctionDef get_all_nodes_by_label(self, label)
**get_all_nodes_by_label**: This function retrieves all nodes from the graph that are associated with a specific label.
parameters:
· label: A string representing the label of the nodes to be retrieved.

Code Description: The function get_all_nodes_by_label is designed to search through the graph managed by an instance of CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV2 and return a list of all nodes that match the provided label. It leverages the method get_all_nodes_by_label from the self.graph object, which presumably contains the logic for searching nodes based on their labels within the graph structure.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to gather information about all entities or concepts in the knowledge base that share a common attribute or classification represented by a specific label. This function is particularly useful for data analysis and retrieval tasks within applications that utilize graph databases or similar structures.

Output Example: If the graph contains nodes labeled "Person", calling get_all_nodes_by_label("Person") might return a list like [UndirectedNode(id=1, label="Person"), UndirectedNode(id=2, label="Person"), ...], where each element in the list is an instance of UndirectedNode that has been tagged with the "Person" label.
***
### FunctionDef update_success_task(self, success_task_info)
**update_success_task**: This function transfers the working trace of successful tasks to a knowledge storage system and updates a graph representation of this knowledge.

**parameters**:
· success_task_info: A string that uniquely identifies the successful task whose information is being processed.

**Code Description**: The function begins by retrieving the working trace for the specified successful task from `self.working_trace_knowledge`. It also attempts to fetch any associated error analysis records, defaulting to an empty list if none are found. 

A new node representing the task description is created and added to the graph with its neighbors being the component nodes associated with this task, as stored in `self.task_to_component_nodes`.

The function then iterates over each unit of the success task trace. For each unit (except the last one), it creates a new node labeled "task_trace" containing the implementation and feedback string of the trace unit. This node is linked to the task description node and any error nodes related to this trace unit. Error nodes are either retrieved from the graph if they already exist or created anew if not.

For the final trace unit, a node labeled "task_success_implement" is created similarly but without adding additional trace nodes as neighbors since it represents the successful completion of the task.

Throughout the process, mappings between node IDs and their corresponding implementation knowledge units are stored in `self.node_to_implementation_knowledge_dict`.

**Note**: This function assumes that all component nodes related to a task are already available in `self.task_to_component_nodes`. It also relies on the existence of methods like `get_node_by_content` and `add_nodes` within the graph object, as well as the presence of `get_implementation_and_feedback_str` method in trace unit objects. Developers should ensure these dependencies are correctly implemented to avoid runtime errors.
***
### FunctionDef query(self)
**query**: This function is intended to perform a query operation on the CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV2. However, based on the current implementation, it does not contain any functionality as its body is empty (indicated by `pass`).

parameters:
· None: The function currently takes no parameters.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `query` method in the CoSTEERKnowledgeBaseV2 class is designed to facilitate querying operations on the knowledge base. As of now, it does not accept any input parameters or return any values because its implementation is incomplete (using the `pass` statement). The purpose of this function would typically be to allow users to search for specific information within the knowledge base using a query string or other criteria.

Note: Usage points.
At present, since the `query` method does not have an implementation, it cannot be used to perform any operations. Developers are advised to implement the necessary logic inside this method to enable querying capabilities. This could involve parsing input queries, searching through stored data, and returning relevant results. Beginners should focus on understanding how query methods generally work in software applications before attempting to implement this function.

### FunctionDef graph_get_node_by_content(self, content)
**graph_get_node_by_content**: This function retrieves a node from the graph based on its content.
parameters:
· content: A string representing the content of the node to be retrieved.

Code Description: The function `graph_get_node_by_content` is designed to search within an undirected graph for a node that matches the specified content. It leverages the method `get_node_by_content` from the graph object, passing the provided content as an argument. This method presumably performs a lookup operation within the graph's data structure to find and return the node whose content attribute matches the input string.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to access specific nodes in the graph based on their content for further processing or analysis. It is important that the content provided exactly matches the content of the target node, as this function performs an exact match lookup.

Output Example: Assuming the graph contains a node with content "example_content", calling `graph_get_node_by_content("example_content")` would return the UndirectedNode object associated with that content. If no such node exists, the behavior (whether it returns None or raises an exception) is determined by the implementation of `get_node_by_content` in the graph class.

### FunctionDef graph_query_by_content(self, content, topk_k, step, constraint_labels, constraint_node, similarity_threshold, constraint_distance, block)
**graph_query_by_content**: This function searches a graph database based on content similarity and connection relationships between nodes. It returns a list of nodes that match the query criteria, up to a specified number (topk_k). If no nodes meet the criteria or if there are no nodes near the constraint_node within the given constraints, it returns an empty list.

**parameters**:
· content: The search content, which can be either a single string or a list of strings. This is used to find nodes with similar content.
· topk_k: An integer specifying the maximum number of results to return for each query. If fewer than topk_k nodes match the criteria, all matching nodes are returned.
· step: An integer that determines how many steps (or hops) the search should take from the starting node(s). This parameter controls the depth of the search in the graph.
· constraint_labels: A list of strings representing labels that nodes must have to be considered during the search. Only nodes with these labels will be included in the results.
· constraint_node: An UndirectedNode object that serves as a starting point for the search. The function will find nodes connected to this node within the specified constraints.
· similarity_threshold: A float value representing the minimum similarity score required for a node's content to match the query content. Nodes with a lower similarity score than this threshold are excluded from the results.
· constraint_distance: A float that specifies the maximum distance (in terms of graph edges) allowed between nodes in the search results and the constraint_node, if provided.
· block: A boolean flag indicating whether the search should be restricted to only flow through nodes with labels specified in constraint_labels. If set to True, the search will not traverse nodes without these labels.

**Code Description**: The function `graph_query_by_content` is designed to perform a content-based search within a graph structure. It leverages various parameters to refine the search process, including specifying the type of nodes to consider (via labels), setting limits on the depth and breadth of the search, and defining minimum similarity requirements for node content. The function internally calls `self.graph.query_by_content`, passing all provided arguments, which suggests that the actual graph querying logic is implemented in another part of the system.

**Note**: When using this function, developers should ensure that the graph structure and nodes are properly defined and populated with data to achieve meaningful search results. Additionally, understanding the implications of each parameter (especially `constraint_labels`, `block`, and `similarity_threshold`) is crucial for tailoring the search to specific needs.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from this function could be a list of UndirectedNode objects that match the query criteria. For instance:
```
[
    <UndirectedNode id=1, labels=['Document'], content='Introduction to Machine Learning'>,
    <UndirectedNode id=3, labels=['Article'], content='Deep Learning Techniques'>
]
``` 
This output represents a list of two nodes, each with an ID, associated labels, and content that aligns with the search query.

### FunctionDef graph_query_by_node(self, node, step, constraint_labels, constraint_node, constraint_distance, block)
**graph_query_by_node**: This function searches a graph starting from a specified node and returns a list of nodes that meet certain constraints. The search is conducted based on connections within the graph, up to a defined number of steps.

parameters:
· node: The starting point for the graph search, represented as an instance of UndirectedNode.
· step: An integer indicating the maximum number of steps (or edges) the search will traverse from the start node. This parameter limits the depth of the search.
· constraint_labels: A list of strings representing labels that output nodes must have. Only nodes with these labels are included in the result.
· constraint_node: Another UndirectedNode instance that the output nodes must be connected to, either directly or indirectly within the specified number of steps.
· constraint_distance: A float value specifying the maximum allowed distance between output nodes and the constraint_node. This parameter is used to filter nodes based on their proximity to the constraint_node.
· block: A boolean flag indicating whether the search should only traverse through nodes that have labels matching those in constraint_labels, except for the start node.

Code Description: The function graph_query_by_node initiates a graph traversal starting from the provided node. It utilizes an internal method self.graph.query_by_node to perform the actual search based on the given parameters. This method returns a list of UndirectedNode instances that satisfy all specified constraints (labels, connection to constraint_node, distance). If no nodes meet these criteria within the allowed steps, an empty list is returned.

Note: The function is designed for scenarios where graph data needs to be queried with specific conditions, such as finding related entities or filtering based on node attributes. It is particularly useful in knowledge management systems and network analysis tasks.

Output Example: Assuming a graph with nodes labeled 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' where 'A' connects to 'B' and 'C', and 'B' connects to 'D'. If the function is called with node='A', step=2, constraint_labels=['D'], constraint_node=None, constraint_distance=0, block=False, it may return [UndirectedNode('B'), UndirectedNode('D')] if these nodes meet all criteria. If no nodes satisfy the conditions, an empty list [] would be returned.

### FunctionDef graph_query_by_intersection(self, nodes, steps, constraint_labels, output_intersection_origin)
**graph_query_by_intersection**: This function searches a graph to find nodes that are intersections of multiple specified nodes within a certain number of steps, optionally filtering by node labels. It returns these intersection nodes sorted by their frequency of occurrence across combinations of input nodes.

parameters:
· nodes: A list of UndirectedNode objects representing the starting points for the search.
· steps: An integer indicating the maximum number of steps to explore from each node in the graph during the search process.
· constraint_labels: An optional list of strings specifying labels that the output nodes must have. If provided, only nodes with these labels will be included in the results.
· output_intersection_origin: A boolean flag indicating whether to return not just the intersection nodes but also the original sets of nodes from which each intersection node was derived.

Code Description: The function begins by ensuring there are at least two nodes in the input list. It then iterates over all possible combinations of these nodes, starting with the largest combination and working down to smaller ones. For each combination, it queries the graph for intersecting nodes within the specified number of steps and optionally filtered by labels. If requested, it also keeps track of which original node sets led to each intersection node.

After collecting all potential intersections, the function sorts them based on their frequency of appearance across different combinations. Nodes that appear more frequently are considered more significant and are placed earlier in the final list. The sorting process ensures that no duplicate nodes are included in the result set.

Note: This function is useful for identifying key points or hubs within a graph that connect multiple paths or regions, especially when combined with label constraints to focus on specific types of nodes.

Output Example: If the input includes three nodes A, B, and C, and the intersection search finds node D as an intersection point reachable from both AB and BC combinations, the output might look like this:

- Without `output_intersection_origin`: [D]
- With `output_intersection_origin`: [[[A, B], D], [[B, C], D]]

This example assumes that D is the only intersection found within the specified constraints.
