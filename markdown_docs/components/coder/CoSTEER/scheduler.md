## FunctionDef random_select(to_be_finished_task_index, evo, selected_num, queried_knowledge, scen)
**random_select**: This function performs a random selection of task indices from a list of tasks that need to be completed. It is designed to select a specified number of tasks randomly, which can be useful in scenarios where prioritization or load balancing among tasks needs to be randomized.

**parameters**:
· to_be_finished_task_index: A list containing the indices of tasks that are yet to be completed.
· evo: An instance of EvolvingItem, likely representing an evolving item or entity within a system. However, this parameter is not utilized within the function and seems extraneous based on the current implementation.
· selected_num: An integer specifying the number of task indices to randomly select from the list.
· queried_knowledge: An instance of CoSTEERQueriedKnowledge, which appears to encapsulate knowledge or data relevant to the querying process. Similar to 'evo', this parameter is not used within the function and may be a placeholder for future functionality.
· scen: An instance of Scenario, representing the scenario in which tasks are being managed. Like the previous parameters, it is not utilized within the current implementation.

**Code Description**: The function begins by using Python's `random.sample` method to randomly select 'selected_num' number of elements from the 'to_be_finished_task_index' list. This ensures that the selection process is unbiased and random. After selecting the tasks, the function logs the selected indices for informational purposes using a logger (presumably defined elsewhere in the codebase). Finally, it returns the list of randomly selected task indices.

**Note**: The parameters 'evo', 'queried_knowledge', and 'scen' are included in the function signature but are not used within the function body. This could indicate that these parameters are intended for future development or were part of a previous implementation that has since been refactored. Developers should be cautious when modifying this function to ensure that any new functionality does not inadvertently rely on these unused parameters.

**Output Example**: If `to_be_finished_task_index` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `selected_num` is `3`, a possible output of the function could be `[2, 0, 4]`. Note that due to the random nature of the selection process, different runs may yield different results.
