## ClassDef CoSTEERSettings
**CoSTEERSettings**: This class defines configuration settings specifically for CoSTEER, a system designed to manage task implementations and knowledge bases. It inherits from `ExtendedBaseSettings` and is intended not to be used directly but rather as a base or reference for configuring CoSTEER instances.

attributes:
· coder_use_cache: A boolean indicating whether caching should be utilized by the coder component of CoSTEER.
· max_loop: An integer representing the maximum number of loops allowed for task implementation processes.
· fail_task_trial_limit: An integer specifying the limit on the number of trials before a task is considered to have failed.
· v1_query_former_trace_limit: An integer defining the trace limit for queries in version 1 of the system.
· v1_query_similar_success_limit: An integer setting the limit for similar successful queries in version 1.
· v2_query_component_limit: An integer indicating the maximum number of components to query in version 2.
· v2_query_error_limit: An integer specifying the error limit for queries in version 2.
· v2_query_former_trace_limit: An integer defining the trace limit for queries in version 2.
· v2_add_fail_attempt_to_latest_successful_execution: A boolean indicating whether failed attempts should be added to the latest successful execution record in version 2.
· v2_error_summary: A boolean flag that determines if an error summary should be generated in version 2.
· v2_knowledge_sampler: A float representing a sampling rate for knowledge in version 2.
· knowledge_base_path: A string or None, indicating the path to the existing knowledge base. If not provided (None), it implies no specific path is set.
· new_knowledge_base_path: A string or None, indicating the path to a new knowledge base. Similar to `knowledge_base_path`, if not provided (None), it indicates no specific path is set.
· select_threshold: An integer setting a threshold for selection processes within CoSTEER.

Code Description: The `CoSTEERSettings` class encapsulates various configuration parameters essential for the operation of the CoSTEER system. It includes settings related to caching, task execution limits, query configurations for different versions (v1 and v2), knowledge base management, and selection thresholds. These attributes are crucial for tailoring the behavior of CoSTEER to specific requirements or environments.

Note: Usage points include configuring instances of CoSTEER by subclassing `CoSTEERSettings` and overriding default values as necessary. Developers should be cautious about modifying these settings directly unless they understand their implications on system performance and functionality. The class is designed with environment variable support through the `env_prefix` attribute, allowing for flexible configuration management in different deployment scenarios.
### ClassDef Config
**Config**: This class serves as a configuration holder specifically designed for CoSTEER settings. It encapsulates environment-specific configurations using a defined prefix.

attributes:
· env_prefix: A string that prefixes environment variables related to CoSTEER settings, ensuring they can be easily identified and managed within the application's environment.

Code Description: The Config class is a simple yet effective way to manage configuration settings for an application named CoSTEER. It includes one attribute, `env_prefix`, which is set to "CoSTEER_". This prefix is used to denote all environment variables that are relevant to the CoSTEER application. By using such a prefix, developers can easily filter and identify these specific settings among other environment variables in their development or production environments.

The use of an environment variable prefix is a common practice in software development, especially when dealing with multiple applications or services that might share the same deployment environment. It helps to avoid naming conflicts and makes it easier to manage configurations for different parts of an application or system.

Note: When using this Config class, developers should ensure that all relevant environment variables are prefixed with "CoSTEER_" to maintain consistency and ease of management. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the configuration settings need to be adjusted without changing the codebase, such as during deployment to different environments (development, testing, production).
