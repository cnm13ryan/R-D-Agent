## ClassDef CoSTEERSingleFeedback
**CoSTEERSingleFeedback**: This class serves as a base class designed to encapsulate feedback related to a single implementation of a code generator. It provides structured attributes for various types of feedback, including execution, shape, code quality, and value feedback, along with final decision-making information.

**attributes**:
· execution_feedback: A string containing feedback about the execution of the generated code.
· shape_feedback: A string providing feedback on the structural aspects or architecture of the code.
· code_feedback: A string offering comments on the coding style, readability, and adherence to best practices.
· value_feedback: A string that includes feedback regarding the functional correctness and utility of the generated code.
· final_decision: A boolean indicating whether the implementation meets the required standards (True for success, False for failure).
· final_feedback: A comprehensive summary or conclusionary feedback about the overall quality of the implementation.
· value_generated_flag: A boolean flag to indicate if a specific value was successfully generated as part of the implementation.
· final_decision_based_on_gt: A boolean indicating whether the final decision is based on comparison with a ground truth (gt_implementation).

**Code Description**: The CoSTEERSingleFeedback class initializes its attributes through its constructor, allowing for detailed feedback to be provided about different aspects of a code implementation. Each attribute can hold a string or boolean value representing specific types of feedback or decisions. The __str__ method is overridden to provide a formatted string representation of the feedback, making it easier to read and understand the various pieces of information encapsulated within an instance of this class.

**Note**: This class is typically used in conjunction with evaluators that assess code implementations against certain criteria or ground truth values. It can be extended or modified to include additional types of feedback as needed for specific use cases.

· final_decision_based_on_gt: A boolean indicating if the final decision was made based on ground truth data.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor for the CoSTEERSingleFeedback class. It takes several parameters that represent different types of feedback and evaluation results from an assessment process, likely related to code quality or performance. Each parameter is assigned to a corresponding attribute within the instance, allowing these values to be accessed and utilized elsewhere in the class methods.

Note: When creating an instance of CoSTEERSingleFeedback, developers can provide specific feedback strings and boolean flags that reflect the evaluation criteria used. This setup allows for detailed tracking and reporting on various aspects of code performance and quality, making it a versatile tool for automated or manual code reviews.
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: This method provides a string representation of an instance of the CoSTEERSingleFeedback class, summarizing various types of feedback received during the evaluation process.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The __str__ method does not take any additional parameters beyond the implicit self parameter which refers to the instance of the class itself.

Code Description: The function constructs a detailed string that includes different categories of feedback such as execution feedback, shape feedback, code feedback, value feedback, and final feedback. Each category is checked for None values; if a particular type of feedback is not available (i.e., it is None), the method substitutes 'No [type] feedback' in its place. The string also includes a final decision based on the evaluation, which is marked as either 'SUCCESS' or 'FAIL' depending on the value of self.final_decision.

Note: This method is particularly useful for debugging and logging purposes, allowing developers to easily understand the outcome of an evaluation by printing or logging the instance directly.

## ClassDef CoSTEERMultiFeedback
**CoSTEERMultiFeedback**: This class encapsulates feedback for multiple implementations of a code generator by containing a list of `CoSTEERSingleFeedback` objects, each corresponding to feedback for a specific factor implementation.

attributes:
· Each element in the list is an instance of `CoSTEERSingleFeedback`, which provides detailed feedback on various aspects such as execution, shape, code quality, and value feedback, along with final decision-making information.

Code Description: The `CoSTEERMultiFeedback` class inherits from both `Feedback` and a list of `CoSTEERSingleFeedback`. This design allows it to behave like a list while also being recognized as a type of feedback. Each element in the list represents feedback for one specific implementation or factor, making it suitable for scenarios where multiple implementations need to be evaluated and their feedback needs to be aggregated.

The class leverages the `CoSTEERSingleFeedback` structure to store detailed information about each implementation's performance across different criteria. This structured approach ensures that all relevant feedback is captured and can be easily accessed or processed later, such as when generating reports or making decisions based on the evaluations.

Note: The `CoSTEERMultiFeedback` class is typically used in conjunction with evaluators like `CoSTEERMultiEvaluator`, which generate multiple `CoSTEERSingleFeedback` instances for different implementations. These instances are then collected into a `CoSTEERMultiFeedback` object, providing a comprehensive overview of the evaluations. This setup is particularly useful in environments where code generation involves multiple factors or sub-tasks that need independent evaluation and feedback aggregation.
## ClassDef CoSTEEREvaluator
**CoSTEEREvaluator**: This class serves as an abstract base class for evaluating implementations against a ground truth implementation within a specific task context using the CoSTEER framework.

attributes:
· target_task: An instance of Task representing the task that is being evaluated.
· implementation: An instance of Workspace containing the candidate implementation to be evaluated.
· gt_implementation: An instance of Workspace containing the ground truth implementation against which the candidate implementation will be compared.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to the evaluate method, providing flexibility for extending functionality without modifying the method signature.

Code Description: The CoSTEEREvaluator class inherits from a base Evaluator class and defines an abstract method named `evaluate`. This method is intended to be overridden by subclasses to provide specific evaluation logic tailored to different types of tasks or criteria. The method takes in three primary parameters: target_task, implementation, and gt_implementation, which represent the task context, the candidate implementation, and the ground truth implementation respectively. Additionally, it accepts any number of keyword arguments through **kwargs, allowing for future extensibility without changing the method signature.

The `evaluate` method is currently not implemented in this abstract class and raises a NotImplementedError to indicate that subclasses must provide their own implementation of this method. This design pattern ensures that all concrete evaluators derived from CoSTEEREvaluator adhere to a consistent interface while providing flexibility in how evaluations are performed.

Note: Usage points include creating subclasses of CoSTEEREvaluator to implement specific evaluation logic for different tasks or criteria within the CoSTEER framework. Instances of these subclasses can then be used by higher-level components, such as CoSTEERMultiEvaluator, which aggregates feedback from multiple evaluators into a comprehensive assessment. Developers should ensure that their implementations of the `evaluate` method return an instance of CoSTEERSingleFeedback to maintain consistency and compatibility with other parts of the system.
### FunctionDef evaluate(self, target_task, implementation, gt_implementation)
**evaluate**: This function is designed to evaluate a given implementation against a target task using a ground truth implementation. It returns feedback encapsulated within an instance of the CoSTEERSingleFeedback class, which includes various types of feedback such as execution, shape, code quality, and value feedback.

parameters:
· target_task: An object representing the specific task that needs to be evaluated. This parameter is expected to be an instance of the Task class.
· implementation: An object representing the workspace or environment containing the generated code that needs to be evaluated. This parameter should be an instance of the Workspace class.
· gt_implementation: An object representing the ground truth workspace or environment against which the generated code will be compared. This parameter is also expected to be an instance of the Workspace class.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to the function, providing flexibility for future extensions or additional parameters.

Code Description: The evaluate function currently raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that it has not been implemented yet. Its purpose is to assess how well the provided implementation meets the requirements specified by the target task when compared against the ground truth implementation. The function is expected to analyze various aspects of the code, such as its execution, structure, coding style, and functional correctness, and provide detailed feedback encapsulated in a CoSTEERSingleFeedback object. This feedback includes specific comments on each aspect of the code and a final decision indicating whether the implementation meets the required standards.

Note: Usage points include integrating this function into an evaluation pipeline where generated code needs to be systematically assessed against predefined tasks and ground truth implementations. Once implemented, developers can use this function to receive comprehensive feedback on their code, aiding in iterative improvements and ensuring that the code meets both functional and quality criteria.

## ClassDef CoSTEERMultiEvaluator
**CoSTEERMultiEvaluator**: This class extends the Evaluator base class to handle multiple evaluations using a single evaluator instance. It is designed to evaluate multiple sub-tasks concurrently, leveraging multiprocessing for efficiency.

attributes:
· single_evaluator: An instance of CoSTEEREvaluator used to evaluate individual sub-tasks.
· *args and **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to the superclass Evaluator's constructor.

Code Description: The CoSTEERMultiEvaluator class is initialized with a specific evaluator (single_evaluator) that will be used for evaluating each sub-task within an evolving item. During evaluation, it processes multiple sub-tasks concurrently by wrapping the single evaluator's evaluate method calls in a multiprocessing function. This allows for parallel execution of evaluations, which can significantly speed up the process when dealing with numerous sub-tasks.

The evaluate method takes an EvolvingItem object and optionally QueriedKnowledge as parameters. It constructs a list of tasks to be evaluated using the single_evaluator's evaluate method. Each task is represented as a tuple containing the method to call and its arguments, which include the specific sub-task, workspace, ground truth implementation (if available), and queried knowledge.

The multiprocessing_wrapper function is then used to execute these tasks in parallel, with the number of processes determined by RD_AGENT_SETTINGS.multi_proc_n. The results from each evaluation are collected into a list called multi_implementation_feedback.

After collecting feedback, the method extracts final decisions from each piece of feedback and logs them along with the count of positive (True) decisions. It then iterates over the sub-tasks, setting the factor_implementation attribute to True for those sub-tasks where the corresponding final decision was True.

Finally, the method returns the multi_implementation_feedback list, which contains detailed feedback from each sub-task evaluation.

Note: This class is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple evaluations need to be performed concurrently and efficiency is a key concern. It requires that the single_evaluator provided supports parallel execution without side effects.

Output Example: A possible return value of the evaluate method could look like this:

[
    CoSTEERFeedback(final_decision=True, score=0.95),
    CoSTEERFeedback(final_decision=False, score=0.42),
    CoSTEERFeedback(final_decision=True, score=0.87)
]

This output indicates that out of three sub-tasks evaluated, two received a final decision of True with scores 0.95 and 0.87 respectively, while one received a False decision with a score of 0.42.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, single_evaluator)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of CoSTEERMultiEvaluator by setting up a single evaluator.

parameters:
· single_evaluator: An instance of CoSTEEREvaluator that will be used for individual evaluations.
· *args: Additional positional arguments to be passed to the superclass constructor.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the superclass constructor.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor for the CoSTEERMultiEvaluator class. It takes a single_evaluator parameter, which must be an instance of CoSTEEREvaluator. This evaluator will be used internally by the CoSTEERMultiEvaluator to perform individual evaluations. The method also accepts any number of additional positional and keyword arguments through *args and **kwargs, respectively. These are passed directly to the constructor of the superclass, allowing for flexibility in extending or modifying the behavior of CoSTEERMultiEvaluator without altering its core initialization logic.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of CoSTEERMultiEvaluator by providing a specific evaluator derived from CoSTEEREvaluator. This setup allows the multi-evaluator to leverage the evaluation logic defined in the single_evaluator for performing comprehensive assessments across multiple criteria or tasks within the CoSTEER framework. Developers should ensure that the provided single_evaluator is properly implemented and adheres to the interface defined by CoSTEEREvaluator, particularly the `evaluate` method.
***
### FunctionDef evaluate(self, evo, queried_knowledge)
**evaluate**: This function evaluates multiple sub-tasks of an evolving item using a specified evaluator and returns feedback for each sub-task.

parameters:
· evo: An instance of `EvolvingItem` that contains sub-tasks, sub-workspaces, and optionally sub-ground truth implementations to be evaluated.
· queried_knowledge: Optional parameter representing knowledge queried during the evaluation process. It is passed to the single evaluator for each sub-task.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to the function.

Code Description: The `evaluate` function processes an evolving item (`evo`) by evaluating its multiple sub-tasks concurrently using a multiprocessing approach. For each sub-task, it calls the `evaluate` method of `self.single_evaluator`, passing in the sub-task, corresponding workspace, ground truth implementation (if available), and queried knowledge.

The evaluations are performed in parallel, with the number of processes determined by `RD_AGENT_SETTINGS.multi_proc_n`. The results from these evaluations are collected into a list called `multi_implementation_feedback`, which contains instances of `CoSTEERSingleFeedback` for each sub-task.

After collecting the feedback, the function logs the final decisions made for each sub-task and counts how many times the decision was True. It then iterates over the sub-tasks again to set the `factor_implementation` attribute to True for those sub-tasks where the evaluation's final decision was True.

Finally, the function returns a `CoSTEERMultiFeedback` object that encapsulates all the feedback collected from evaluating the sub-tasks.

Note: This function is designed to handle scenarios where an evolving item consists of multiple sub-tasks that need independent evaluation. It leverages multiprocessing for efficiency and aggregates the results into a structured format using the `CoSTEERMultiFeedback` class.

Output Example: A possible return value could be an instance of `CoSTEERMultiFeedback` containing several `CoSTEERSingleFeedback` objects, each with detailed feedback on execution, shape, code quality, and value, along with a final decision for each sub-task. For example:

```
[
    CoSTEERSingleFeedback(execution_feedback=..., shape_feedback=..., code_quality_feedback=..., value_feedback=..., final_decision=True),
    CoSTEERSingleFeedback(execution_feedback=..., shape_feedback=..., code_quality_feedback=..., value_feedback=..., final_decision=False),
    ...
]
```
