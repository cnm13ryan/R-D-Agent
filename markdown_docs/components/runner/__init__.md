## ClassDef CachedRunner
**CachedRunner**: A specialized class designed to manage caching mechanisms for experiments by extending the `Developer[ASpecificExp]` class. It includes methods to generate cache keys based on experiment details and to assign cached results back to an experiment.

attributes:
· exp: An instance of the Experiment class representing the current experimental setup.
· cached_res: An instance of the Experiment class containing previously computed results that can be reused.

Code Description: The `CachedRunner` class is designed to optimize computational resources by leveraging caching. It contains two primary methods:

1. **get_cache_key**: This method constructs a unique cache key for an experiment based on its tasks and sub-tasks. It aggregates all the tasks from both the current experiment and any experiments it is based on, then generates a string representation of these tasks' information. The final step involves hashing this string using an MD5 hash function to produce a concise, unique identifier (cache key) that can be used for caching purposes.

2. **assign_cached_result**: This method takes two Experiment objects as input: the current experiment (`exp`) and an experiment containing cached results (`cached_res`). It checks if the last based experiment in `exp` has a result assigned; if not, it assigns the corresponding result from `cached_res`. Then, it assigns the overall result of `cached_res` to `exp`, effectively reusing previously computed data.

Note: The usage of this class is particularly beneficial when dealing with experiments that involve repetitive or computationally expensive tasks. By caching results and reusing them when possible, developers can significantly reduce computation time and resource consumption.

Output Example: Suppose we have an experiment setup where the task information for all sub-tasks combined is "Task1\nTask2\nSubTaskA". The `get_cache_key` method would generate a cache key by hashing this string. If there exists a cached result with the same hash, the `assign_cached_result` method can be used to assign these results back to the current experiment, saving computational effort.

In summary, the `CachedRunner` class provides essential functionalities for managing and utilizing cached experimental results, thereby enhancing efficiency in experimental setups involving repetitive tasks.
### FunctionDef get_cache_key(self, exp)
**get_cache_key**: This function generates a cache key based on the tasks associated with an experiment and its base experiments. The cache key is used to uniquely identify the state of these tasks, facilitating caching mechanisms.

parameters:
· exp: An instance of the Experiment class representing the current experiment for which the cache key needs to be generated.

Code Description: The function starts by initializing an empty list named `all_tasks`. It then iterates over each base experiment in the provided experiment's `based_experiments` attribute, extending the `all_tasks` list with the sub-tasks of each base experiment. After processing all base experiments, it extends `all_tasks` with the sub-tasks of the current experiment itself.

Next, the function creates a list called `task_info_list`, which contains string representations of task information for every task in `all_tasks`. This is achieved by calling the `get_task_information()` method on each task object. The strings in `task_info_list` are then joined into a single string with newline characters separating them, forming `task_info_str`.

Finally, the function returns an MD5 hash of `task_info_str`, which serves as the cache key for the experiment and its tasks.

Note: This function assumes that each task object has a method named `get_task_information()` that returns a string representation of the task's relevant information. The returned hash is consistent for identical sets of tasks, making it suitable for caching purposes.

Output Example: A possible return value of this function could be "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e", which is the MD5 hash of an empty string. However, in practice, the output will vary based on the content of `task_info_str`.

### FunctionDef assign_cached_result(self, exp, cached_res)
**assign_cached_result**: This function updates an experiment object's result by assigning a cached result to it. If the experiment is based on previous experiments, it also assigns the result of the last based experiment from the cache.

parameters:
· exp: An Experiment object representing the current experiment that needs its result updated.
· cached_res: An Experiment object containing the cached results that will be used to update the current experiment's result.

Code Description: The function first checks if the current experiment (exp) is based on other experiments by examining the `based_experiments` attribute. If this list is not empty and the last based experiment does not have a result assigned (`result is None`), it assigns the result from the corresponding last based experiment in the cached results (`cached_res.based_experiments[-1].result`). After handling the based experiments, it directly assigns the overall result from the cached results to the current experiment. Finally, the function returns the updated experiment object.

Note: This function is useful when reusing previously computed results to avoid redundant computations and speed up processing times in scenarios where experiments are dependent on each other.

Output Example: If `exp` initially has no result and its last based experiment also lacks a result, and `cached_res` provides both results, the function will update `exp` such that it reflects these cached results. For instance, if `exp.based_experiments[-1].result` was None and `cached_res.based_experiments[-1].result` is "Success", then after calling this function, `exp.based_experiments[-1].result` will be updated to "Success". Similarly, if `exp.result` was None and `cached_res.result` is "Completed", then `exp.result` will also be set to "Completed". The returned `exp` object now includes these updates.
