## ClassDef KnowledgeMetaData
**KnowledgeMetaData**: This class represents metadata associated with a piece of knowledge, including its content, label, unique identifier, embedding, and trunks (subsections) along with their embeddings.

attributes:
· content: A string representing the main body or content of the knowledge.
· label: An optional string that can be used to categorize or describe the type of content.
· embedding: An optional variable that holds an embedding representation of the content. Embeddings are typically numerical vectors used in machine learning and natural language processing tasks.
· identity: An optional unique identifier for the knowledge metadata instance. If not provided, a UUID is generated based on the DNS namespace and the content.

Code Description: The KnowledgeMetaData class initializes with attributes for content, label, embedding, and identity. If no identity is provided, it generates a UUID using the DNS namespace and the content string to ensure uniqueness. It includes methods to split the content into trunks of specified size with optional overlap, create embeddings for both the entire content and its trunks, populate the object's attributes from a dictionary, and provide a string representation of the instance.

Note: The `split_into_trunk` method splits the content into smaller chunks (trunks) based on the provided size and overlap parameters. It then generates embeddings for each trunk using an APIBackend service. The `create_embedding` method is used to generate an embedding for the entire content if it does not already exist. The `from_dict` method allows initializing or updating a KnowledgeMetaData instance with data from a dictionary, making it flexible for various use cases.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value when calling `__repr__()` on an instance of KnowledgeMetaData could be:
Document(id=6fa459ea-ee8a-3ca4-894e-db77e160355e, label=None, data=This is a sample content for knowledge management.)
### FunctionDef __init__(self, content, label, embedding, identity)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the KnowledgeMetaData class, setting up essential attributes for managing knowledge data.

parameters:
· content: A string representing the main content or text associated with this metadata entry. Defaults to an empty string if not provided.
· label: An optional string used to categorize or tag the metadata entry. It can be None if no specific label is assigned.
· embedding: An optional parameter that holds a representation of the content in a vector space, typically used for semantic similarity searches. This could be any data type suitable for storing such embeddings, but it defaults to None if not provided.
· identity: An optional unique identifier for this metadata entry. If not specified (None), an identifier is automatically generated using UUID version 3 based on the DNS namespace and the content string.

Code Description: The constructor method __init__ sets up a new KnowledgeMetaData object with several key attributes:
- It assigns the provided label to self.label, which can be used for categorization or filtering.
- The content parameter is assigned to self.content, storing the primary text or data associated with this metadata instance.
- For the unique identifier (self.id), if an identity is not provided, a UUID version 3 is generated using the DNS namespace and the string representation of the content. This ensures that the same content will always produce the same ID, which can be useful for consistency across different systems or sessions.
- The embedding parameter is directly assigned to self.embedding, allowing for semantic analysis if embeddings are used in the application.
- Two lists, self.trunks and self.trunks_embedding, are initialized as empty. These could be intended for storing additional segments of content (trunks) and their corresponding embeddings, respectively, though they are not populated within this constructor.

Note: When creating a KnowledgeMetaData object, developers can provide values for content, label, embedding, and identity to customize the metadata entry according to their needs. If no identity is provided, a unique identifier will be automatically generated based on the content, ensuring that identical contents receive the same ID. This automatic generation of IDs can simplify data management in systems where uniqueness is crucial but manual assignment might be cumbersome or error-prone.

### FunctionDef split_into_trunk(self, size, overlap)
**split_into_trunk**: This function splits the content of an object into smaller segments (trunks) based on a specified size, with optional overlap between these segments. It then generates embeddings for each trunk using an API backend.

parameters:
· size: An integer that defines the maximum number of characters in each trunk. The default value is 1000.
· overlap: An integer indicating the number of overlapping characters between consecutive trunks. Currently, this parameter is not utilized within the function but is included in the method signature.

Code Description: The function begins by defining a nested helper function named `split_string_into_chunks`. This helper function takes a string and a chunk size as input and returns a list of substrings (chunks) where each substring has a length equal to or less than the specified chunk size. It iterates over the input string in steps determined by the chunk size, slicing the string into chunks and appending them to a list.

After defining the helper function, `split_into_trunk` calls it with the content of the object (`self.content`) and the provided `size` parameter to generate the trunks. The resulting list of trunks is stored in the `trunks` attribute of the object.

Subsequently, the function creates embeddings for each trunk using an API backend by calling the `create_embedding` method on an instance of `APIBackend`. The input content for embedding creation is set to the list of trunks (`self.trunks`). The generated embeddings are stored in the `trunks_embedding` attribute of the object.

Note: Usage points. This function is particularly useful when dealing with large pieces of text that need to be processed or analyzed in smaller, manageable segments. By splitting the content into trunks and generating embeddings for each trunk, it becomes easier to perform tasks such as similarity searches, clustering, or classification on individual parts of the text.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
After calling `split_into_trunk` with default parameters on an object containing the content "This is a sample text for testing purposes.", the following attributes might be set:
- `self.trunks`: ['This is a sample text for testing purposes.']
- `self.trunks_embedding`: [embedding_vector_for_first_trunk] (where embedding_vector_for_first_trunk is a vector representation of the first trunk generated by the API backend)
#### FunctionDef split_string_into_chunks(string, chunk_size)
**split_string_into_chunks**: This function takes a string and splits it into smaller chunks of a specified size.

parameters:
· string: The input string to be split.
· chunk_size: An integer representing the maximum size of each chunk.

Code Description: The function initializes an empty list named `chunks` to store the resulting substrings. It then iterates over the input string in steps defined by `chunk_size`. During each iteration, a substring from the current index up to `chunk_size` characters ahead is extracted and appended to the `chunks` list. This process continues until the entire string has been processed. Finally, the function returns the list of chunks.

Note: The last chunk may be shorter than `chunk_size` if the length of the input string is not a perfect multiple of `chunk_size`. It's important that `chunk_size` is greater than zero to avoid infinite loops or errors during execution.

Output Example: If the input string is "abcdefghij" and the chunk size is 3, the function will return ['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'j'].
***
***
### FunctionDef create_embedding(self)
**create_embedding**: This function generates an embedding for the content associated with a KnowledgeMetaData object if it does not already exist.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The function operates on the instance attributes of the class, specifically `self.embedding` and `self.content`.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `create_embedding` method checks whether the `embedding` attribute of the current instance is `None`. If it is, indicating that an embedding has not yet been created for the content, the method proceeds to generate one. This is done by calling the `create_embedding` method on an instance of `APIBackend`, passing in `self.content` as the input content. The result from this API call is then assigned to the `embedding` attribute of the current instance.

Note: Usage points.
This function is crucial for ensuring that each piece of content has a corresponding embedding, which is essential for operations such as adding new documents to a vector database or searching for similar documents based on their embeddings. The method is invoked in other parts of the codebase, specifically within the `add` and `search` methods of the `PDVectorBase` class. In these contexts, it ensures that any document being added to the vector database or searched against has an embedding before proceeding with further operations. This guarantees that all documents are represented in a format suitable for vector-based similarity searches.
***
### FunctionDef from_dict(self, data)
**from_dict**: This function populates an instance of a class with data from a dictionary. It iterates over each key-value pair in the provided dictionary, setting attributes on the current object to match the keys and values.

parameters:
· data: A dictionary where keys correspond to attribute names of the object and values are the desired values for those attributes.

Code Description: The function `from_dict` is designed to dynamically set attributes on an instance based on the contents of a dictionary. It uses Python's built-in `setattr` function, which allows setting an attribute value by name. For each key-value pair in the input dictionary, it sets the corresponding attribute on the object (`self`) to the given value. This method is particularly useful for initializing or updating objects with data that comes in dictionary form, such as when parsing JSON data or loading configurations.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where an object needs to be initialized or updated based on external data sources like configuration files, API responses, or database records. It's important that the keys in the dictionary match the attribute names of the class for this function to work correctly.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming we have a class `KnowledgeMetaData` with attributes `title`, `description`, and `tags`, and we call `from_dict` with the following dictionary:

```python
data = {
    "title": "Introduction to Machine Learning",
    "description": "A comprehensive guide to machine learning concepts.",
    "tags": ["machine learning", "AI", "introduction"]
}
```

After calling `knowledge_meta_data_instance.from_dict(data)`, the instance `knowledge_meta_data_instance` will have its attributes set as follows:

- knowledge_meta_data_instance.title = "Introduction to Machine Learning"
- knowledge_meta_data_instance.description = "A comprehensive guide to machine learning concepts."
- knowledge_meta_data_instance.tags = ["machine learning", "AI", "introduction"]

The function returns the modified instance itself, allowing for method chaining if needed.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: This method returns a string representation of an instance of the KnowledgeMetaData class, which is useful for debugging and logging purposes.
parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The __repr__ method does not take any additional parameters besides the implicit 'self', which refers to the instance of the class.

Code Description: The __repr__ method is a special Python method used to define the string representation of an object. In this implementation, it constructs and returns a formatted string that includes the id, label, and content attributes of the KnowledgeMetaData instance. This allows developers to easily identify the key properties of an object when printed or logged.

Note: The __repr__ method is intended to be unambiguous and, if possible, match the code necessary to recreate the object. However, in this case, it provides a clear and concise representation rather than a full constructor call.

Output Example: When an instance of KnowledgeMetaData with id=123, label='example', and content='This is some example content.' is printed or logged, the output will be:
Document(id=123, label=example, data=This is some example content.)
***
## FunctionDef contents_to_documents(contents, label)
**contents_to_documents**: This function processes a list of string contents into a list of Document objects, each containing an embedding generated from the content.

parameters:
· contents: A list of strings where each string represents a piece of text to be converted into a document.
· label: An optional string that can be used to categorize or identify the documents. If not provided, it defaults to None.

Code Description: The function begins by defining a size variable set to 16, which corresponds to the maximum length of input content allowed by the OpenAI embedding API in one request. It initializes an empty list called embedding to store the embeddings generated from the contents.

The function then iterates over the contents list in chunks of the defined size (16). For each chunk, it calls the create_embedding method of the APIBackend class, passing the chunk as input_content. The resulting embeddings are added to the embedding list using the extend method.

After generating all embeddings, the function creates a list of Document objects by zipping together the contents and their corresponding embeddings. Each Document object is initialized with its content, label (if provided), and embedding. This list of Document objects is then returned as the output.

Note: The function assumes that the APIBackend class has a method called create_embedding which takes an input_content parameter and returns a list of embeddings. It also assumes that the Document class can be instantiated with parameters for content, label, and embedding.

Output Example: If the contents list contains ["Hello", "World"] and the label is "Greeting", the function might return a list like this:
[
    Document(content="Hello", label="Greeting", embedding=[0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9]),
    Document(content="World", label="Greeting", embedding=[0.3, 0.4, ..., 0.8])
]
where the embeddings are lists of floating-point numbers representing the vectorized form of the contents.
## ClassDef VectorBase
**VectorBase**: This class serves as a foundational interface for managing vector storage and querying operations within a knowledge management system. It provides methods to add new documents to a vector store and search for similar documents based on content similarity.

attributes:
· document: An instance or list of Document objects that are intended to be added to the vector storage.
· content: A string representing the query content used to search for similar documents in the vector storage.
· topk_k: An integer specifying the number of top-k most similar documents to return from a search operation. The default value is 5.
· similarity_threshold: A float indicating the minimum similarity score required for a document to be considered as a match during a search operation. The default value is 0, meaning no threshold.

Code Description: VectorBase defines two primary methods: `add` and `search`. The `add` method is designed to accept either a single Document object or a list of Document objects and add them to the vector storage. This method does not perform any specific operations in the base class but serves as a placeholder for subclasses that will implement the actual logic.

The `search` method takes a string content, an integer topk_k, and a float similarity_threshold as parameters. It is intended to search through the vector storage to find documents similar to the provided content based on their embeddings. The method should return a list of Document objects that match the criteria along with their corresponding similarity scores.

Note: Usage points include extending this class to implement specific storage mechanisms (e.g., using Pandas, databases) and overriding the `add` and `search` methods to provide concrete functionality for adding documents and searching for similar content.

Output Example: A possible return value from the `search` method could be a list of Document objects along with their similarity scores. For instance:
[
    (Document(id=1, label='example', content='This is an example document'), 0.95),
    (Document(id=2, label='related', content='Another related document'), 0.87)
]
Here, the first element in each tuple is a Document object, and the second element is its similarity score to the query content.
### FunctionDef add(self, document)
**add**: This function is designed to add new document(s) to a vector data frame (vector_df). It accepts either a single Document object or a list of Document objects as input, facilitating the integration of one or multiple documents into the existing vector database.

**parameters**:
· document: A parameter that can be either a single instance of the Document class or a list containing multiple instances of the Document class. This allows for flexible addition of documents to the vector data frame.

**Code Description**: The function is currently defined with a pass statement, indicating that its implementation is pending. Its purpose is clear from the docstring: it should handle the logic necessary to add new document(s) to the vector_df. Developers implementing this function will need to ensure that each Document object's relevant attributes are correctly processed and added to the data frame in a manner consistent with the overall structure and requirements of the vector database.

**Note**: Usage points include ensuring that the Document class is properly defined elsewhere in the codebase, as well as considering how document metadata or content should be handled when adding them to the vector_df. Developers should also consider edge cases, such as handling empty lists or invalid Document objects, to make the function robust and reliable.
***
### FunctionDef search(self, content, topk_k, similarity_threshold)
**search**: This function performs a search operation within a vector database to find documents similar to the given content. It returns a list of the top-k most similar documents based on a similarity score, with an option to filter results by a minimum similarity threshold.

parameters:
· content: A string representing the query or text for which similar documents are sought.
· topk_k: An integer specifying the number of top similar documents to return. The default value is 5.
· similarity_threshold: A float indicating the minimum similarity score required for a document to be included in the results. Documents with a similarity score below this threshold will not be returned, even if they are among the top-k most similar. The default value is 0, which means no filtering by similarity score.

Code Description: The function is designed to search through a vector database (referred to as `vector_df` in the comments) for documents that match the input content based on their semantic similarity. It utilizes vector representations of the documents and computes similarity scores between these vectors and the vector representation of the input content. The results are then filtered and sorted to return the top-k most similar documents, with an option to apply a minimum similarity threshold.

Note: This function is part of a class that likely handles operations related to vector-based knowledge management. It assumes the existence of a method or mechanism for converting text into vectors and computing their similarities. Developers should ensure that the `vector_df` attribute of the class instance contains valid, precomputed document vectors before calling this function.

Output Example: Assuming the function is called with content="machine learning", topk_k=3, and similarity_threshold=0.8, a possible return value could be:
[
    Document(text="An introduction to machine learning techniques...", similarity_score=0.92),
    Document(text="Advanced machine learning algorithms explained...", similarity_score=0.85),
    Document(text="Machine learning applications in healthcare...", similarity_score=0.81)
]
Each `Document` object contains the text of a document and its similarity score relative to the input content.
***
## ClassDef PDVectorBase
**PDVectorBase**: This class implements the VectorBase interface using Pandas to manage vector storage and querying operations within a knowledge management system. It provides concrete methods for adding new documents to a vector store and searching for similar documents based on content similarity.

attributes:
· path: A string or Path object representing the file path where the vector data is stored. This parameter is optional and defaults to None if not provided.

**Code Description**: PDVectorBase extends VectorBase and overrides its methods to provide specific functionality using Pandas DataFrames. The class initializes with an empty DataFrame that has columns for document ID, label, content, and embedding. The `add` method accepts either a single Document object or a list of Document objects. If the document's embedding is not already created, it generates one. For each document, it adds a row to the DataFrame containing the document's details and embeddings. If the document has multiple trunks (sub-documents), it also adds rows for these trunks.

The `search` method takes a string content, an integer topk_k, and a float similarity_threshold as parameters. It searches through the vector storage to find documents similar to the provided content based on their embeddings. The method calculates cosine similarities between the query document's embedding and each document in the DataFrame. It returns a list of Document objects that have a similarity score above the threshold, along with their corresponding similarity scores.

**Note**: This class is suitable for developers who need a simple vector storage solution using Pandas. It can be extended or modified to integrate with other data storage mechanisms if needed.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `search` method could be:
[
    (Document(id=1, label='example', content='This is an example document'), 0.95),
    (Document(id=2, label='related', content='Another related document'), 0.87)
]
Here, each tuple contains a Document object and its similarity score to the query content.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the PDVectorBase class, setting up a DataFrame to store vector data and optionally accepting a path for further operations.

parameters:
· path: A string or Path object representing the file system path where vector data might be stored or loaded from. This parameter is optional and defaults to None if not provided.

Code Description: The __init__ method performs two main actions when an instance of PDVectorBase is created. First, it initializes a pandas DataFrame named `vector_df` with predefined columns: "id", "label", "content", and "embedding". These columns are intended to store unique identifiers for each vector entry, labels associated with the vectors, the content that generated the vectors, and the vector embeddings themselves, respectively. The second action is to call the constructor of the superclass (presumably a base class related to knowledge management or data handling) using `super().__init__(path)`, passing along the provided path parameter if it was given. This allows for any additional initialization logic defined in the superclass to be executed.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of PDVectorBase with or without specifying a path. If a path is provided, it can be used by methods in the class (or its superclass) to load existing vector data from a file system location or to save new data there. The DataFrame `vector_df` serves as the primary storage mechanism for managing vector-related information within this instance of PDVectorBase.
***
### FunctionDef shape(self)
**shape**: This function returns the shape of the DataFrame stored in the `vector_df` attribute of the PDVectorBase class.
parameters:
· No parameters: The `shape` method does not accept any input arguments.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `shape` function is a simple accessor method that leverages the built-in `.shape` attribute of a pandas DataFrame. In this context, `self.vector_df` refers to an instance of a pandas DataFrame that holds vector data within the PDVectorBase class. When called, the `shape` method returns a tuple representing the dimensionality of the DataFrame. The first element of the tuple is the number of rows (observations), and the second element is the number of columns (features or dimensions) in the DataFrame.

Note: Usage points.
This function is particularly useful for quickly assessing the size of the dataset managed by an instance of PDVectorBase, which can be crucial for debugging, data validation, and understanding the scale of operations that will be performed on the vector data. Developers can use this method to ensure their data aligns with expected dimensions before proceeding with further processing or analysis.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
(1000, 30)
This output indicates that the DataFrame `vector_df` contains 1000 rows and 30 columns.
***
### FunctionDef add(self, document)
**add**: This function adds new document(s) to the vector database by updating the `vector_df` DataFrame with the document's details, including its embedding.

parameters:
· document: A single Document object or a list of Document objects to be added to the vector database.

Code Description: The `add` method is designed to handle both individual documents and lists of documents. It first checks if the input `document` is an instance of the `Document` class. If it is, the method proceeds to ensure that the document has an embedding by calling the `create_embedding` method on the document object if its `embedding` attribute is `None`. After ensuring the presence of an embedding, it constructs a list of dictionaries (`docs`) containing the document's metadata and embeddings. This includes both the main content and any additional trunks with their respective embeddings. The constructed data is then converted into a DataFrame and concatenated to the existing `vector_df`, effectively adding the new document(s) to the vector database.

If the input `document` is not an instance of the `Document` class, it assumes that the input is a list of Document objects. In this case, the method iterates over each document in the list and recursively calls itself with each individual document, ensuring that all documents in the list are processed and added to the vector database.

Note: Usage points. This function is essential for populating the vector database with new documents. It ensures that each document has an embedding before adding it to the database, which is crucial for performing similarity searches based on embeddings. The method handles both single documents and lists of documents, making it versatile for different use cases. Developers can use this function to add new knowledge or data to the system, enabling enhanced search capabilities and information retrieval.
***
### FunctionDef search(self, content, topk_k, similarity_threshold)
**search**: This function performs a vector-based search to find documents similar to the given content within a predefined similarity threshold and returns the top k most similar documents.

parameters:
· content: A string representing the text content for which similar documents are to be searched.
· topk_k: An integer specifying the number of top similar documents to return. The default value is 5.
· similarity_threshold: A float indicating the minimum similarity score a document must have to be considered in the results. Documents with a similarity score below this threshold will not be included, even if they are among the top k most similar. The default value is 0.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if there are any documents stored in `self.vector_df`. If no documents exist, it immediately returns two empty lists. Otherwise, it creates a new `Document` object from the provided content and generates its embedding using the `create_embedding` method. It then calculates the cosine similarity between this document's embedding and the embeddings of all documents in `self.vector_df`, converting these similarities to distances by subtracting them from 1 (since cosine distance is used here). The function filters out any documents whose similarity score does not exceed the specified `similarity_threshold`. From the remaining documents, it selects the top k most similar ones based on their similarity scores. These documents are then converted back into `Document` objects using the `from_dict` method and returned along with their corresponding similarity scores as a list.

Note: This function is essential for retrieving relevant documents from a vector database based on content similarity. It ensures that only documents meeting the minimum similarity threshold are considered, which can help in filtering out irrelevant results. The use of cosine distance allows for efficient computation of document similarities in high-dimensional spaces, making it suitable for applications involving large text corpora.

Output Example: Assuming we have a `PDVectorBase` instance with several documents stored and we call `search` with the following parameters:

```python
content = "Introduction to Machine Learning"
topk_k = 3
similarity_threshold = 0.75
```

The function might return something like this:

- A list of `Document` objects, each representing a document similar to the provided content:
    - Document(title="Machine Learning Basics", description="An overview of machine learning concepts.", tags=["machine learning", "basics"])
    - Document(title="Advanced Machine Learning Techniques", description="Exploring advanced techniques in machine learning.", tags=["advanced", "machine learning"])
    - Document(title="Introduction to AI", description="A beginner's guide to artificial intelligence.", tags=["AI", "introduction"])

- A list of similarity scores corresponding to each document:
    - [0.85, 0.79, 0.76]

These results indicate that the first document has a similarity score of 0.85 with the provided content, making it the most similar, followed by the second and third documents with scores of 0.79 and 0.76, respectively. Only these three documents meet the specified `similarity_threshold` of 0.75 and are among the top 3 most similar documents.
