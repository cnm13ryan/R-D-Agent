## ClassDef UndirectedNode
**UndirectedNode**: Represents a node in an undirected graph, capable of storing content, label, and embedding information. It manages its neighbors and provides methods to add, remove, and retrieve them.

attributes:
· content: A string representing the main data or information stored within the node.
· label: A string used for categorizing or tagging the node.
· embedding: An optional parameter that can store any type of embedding (e.g., vector representation) associated with the node's content.
· neighbors: A set containing references to other UndirectedNode instances, representing nodes directly connected to this one.

Code Description: The UndirectedNode class inherits from a base Node class. It initializes with content, label, and an optional embedding. An assertion ensures that the content is always a string. Each node maintains a set of neighbors, which are also instances of UndirectedNode. Methods include adding and removing neighbors, ensuring mutual connections between nodes when adding or removing. The get_neighbors method returns the current set of connected nodes. Both __str__ and __repr__ methods provide string representations of the node for easy debugging and logging.

Note: When adding a neighbor to an UndirectedNode, both nodes are updated to reflect their connection, maintaining the undirected nature of the graph. Removing a neighbor also ensures that the connection is severed from both nodes.

Output Example: 
UndirectedNode(id=12345, label='example_label', content='This is an example node content...', neighbors={UndirectedNode(id=67890, ...), UndirectedNode(id=54321, ...)})
### FunctionDef __init__(self, content, label, embedding)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the UndirectedNode class, setting up its content, label, embedding, and initializing a set to hold neighboring nodes.

parameters:
· content: A string representing the main data or information stored within the node. Defaults to an empty string if not provided.
· label: A string that can be used to identify or categorize the node. This is optional and defaults to an empty string if not specified.
· embedding: An optional parameter that can store any type of data (as indicated by Any). It could represent a vector or other form of encoded information related to the node's content.

Code Description: The __init__ method first calls the superclass's initializer with the provided content, label, and embedding. This suggests that UndirectedNode likely inherits from another class, possibly Node, which handles basic initialization for nodes in a graph structure. After calling the superclass initializer, it initializes an instance variable neighbors as an empty set. This set is intended to store references to other UndirectedNode instances that are directly connected to this node, forming part of the undirected graph's adjacency list representation. The method concludes with an assertion that checks if the content provided is indeed a string, ensuring type safety and preventing runtime errors related to incorrect data types.

Note: When creating an instance of UndirectedNode, developers should provide valid string inputs for both content and label parameters unless they intend to use their default values. The embedding parameter can be omitted or set to any object that represents the node's additional information in a suitable format. Proper initialization is crucial as it sets up the basic structure and data of each node within an undirected graph, facilitating operations such as traversal and analysis.
***
### FunctionDef add_neighbor(self, node)
**add_neighbor**: This function establishes a bidirectional connection between two nodes in an undirected graph by adding each node as a neighbor to the other.

parameters:
· node: An instance of UndirectedNode that will be added as a neighbor to the current node.

Code Description: The method `add_neighbor` is designed to add a given node (`node`) to the set of neighbors of the current node. It performs this operation in two steps:
1. It adds the provided `node` to the `neighbors` attribute, which is expected to be a set that holds references to all neighboring nodes.
2. Simultaneously, it ensures the bidirectional nature of the graph by adding the current node (`self`) to the `neighbors` set of the provided `node`. This step guarantees that if node A considers node B as its neighbor, then node B also considers node A as its neighbor.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where you need to manually connect two nodes in an undirected graph. Typically, this function is called after both nodes have been added to the graph structure, ensuring they are recognized and can be linked properly. It's important that `node` is a valid instance of UndirectedNode; otherwise, it may lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior. This method does not return any value (`None`) as its primary purpose is to modify the state of the node objects involved in establishing their neighbor relationship.
***
### FunctionDef remove_neighbor(self, node)
**remove_neighbor**: This function is designed to remove a specified neighbor from an undirected node within a graph data structure. It ensures that the relationship between nodes is bidirectional by also removing the reference of the current node from the neighbor's list of neighbors.

parameters:
· node: An instance of UndirectedNode representing the neighbor to be removed from the current node's adjacency list.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the provided node exists in the current node's neighbors list. If it does, the node is removed from this list using the `remove` method. Following this, the function also removes the current node from the neighbors list of the specified node, ensuring that both nodes no longer reference each other as neighbors. This bidirectional removal maintains the integrity of the undirected graph structure.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where it is necessary to modify the connections between nodes in a graph dynamically, such as when deleting an edge or restructuring parts of the graph. It is important to ensure that the node provided as an argument is indeed a neighbor of the current node to avoid errors during execution.
***
### FunctionDef get_neighbors(self)
**get_neighbors**: This function retrieves a set of neighboring nodes connected to the current undirected node within a graph structure.
parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The method does not take any external input parameters; it operates on the internal state of the UndirectedNode instance.

Code Description: The `get_neighbors` function is designed to return all nodes that are directly connected to the node from which this method is called. In graph theory, these directly connected nodes are referred to as neighbors. The function accesses a property or attribute named `neighbors`, which should be a set containing instances of `UndirectedNode`. By returning this set, the function provides an easy way for developers to access all adjacent nodes in one go.

Note: Usage points. This method is particularly useful when traversing graphs or performing operations that require knowledge of connected nodes, such as finding paths, checking connectivity, or implementing graph algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming there are three other nodes named `node2`, `node3`, and `node4` that are directly connected to the current node, calling `get_neighbors()` on this node would return:
{node2, node3, node4}
This output represents a set containing references to the neighboring nodes.
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: This method returns a string representation of an UndirectedNode object, providing essential information about its attributes.
parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The __str__ method does not accept any additional parameters beyond the implicit self parameter which refers to the instance of the class.

Code Description: The __str__ method is designed to generate a human-readable string that summarizes key aspects of an UndirectedNode object. It includes the node's ID, label, and content (truncated to the first 100 characters for brevity), as well as its neighbors. This method facilitates debugging and logging by offering a concise overview of the node's state.

Note: The __str__ method is automatically invoked when you use the print() function on an instance of UndirectedNode or when str() is called on such an instance. It is particularly useful for developers to quickly understand the structure and data contained within graph nodes without needing to access individual attributes directly.

Output Example: If there were an UndirectedNode with id=1, label='Example Node', content='This is a detailed description of the node that should be truncated after 100 characters...', and neighbors=[2, 3], calling print(node) would output:
UndirectedNode(id=1, label=Example Node, content=This is a detailed description of the node that should be truncated after 100 charact..., neighbors=[2, 3])
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: This method returns a string representation of an UndirectedNode object, which includes its id, label, content (truncated to 100 characters), and neighbors.
parameters:
· None: The __repr__ method does not take any parameters; it operates on the instance attributes of the UndirectedNode class.
Code Description: The __repr__ method is a special Python method used to define a string representation for an object that can be useful for debugging. In this implementation, it constructs a detailed string that includes the node's id, label, and content (limited to the first 100 characters to avoid overly long strings). Additionally, it lists the neighbors of the node, which are presumably other nodes connected to it in an undirected graph.
Note: The __repr__ method is intended for developers as a debugging aid. It should provide enough information to understand what the object represents and its current state. In this case, it provides a concise yet informative summary of the UndirectedNode instance.
Output Example: "UndirectedNode(id=123, label='Example Node', content='This is an example node with some content that will be truncated after 100 characters...', neighbors=[<UndirectedNode id=456>, <UndirectedNode id=789>])"
***
## ClassDef Graph
**Graph**: Base Graph class designed for knowledge graph search operations.
attributes:
· path: Optional parameter specifying the file path to load/save graph data.

Code Description: The `Graph` class serves as a foundational structure for managing nodes within a knowledge graph. It initializes with an optional path parameter, which can be used to specify where graph data is stored or loaded from. Internally, it maintains a dictionary of nodes, indexed by their unique identifiers (node_id). The class provides methods to interact with these nodes, such as retrieving the size of the graph, accessing individual nodes, adding new nodes, and finding nodes based on specific criteria.

The `size` method returns the total number of nodes in the graph. The `get_node` method retrieves a node by its unique identifier. The `add_node` method is intended to add new nodes to the graph but currently raises a `NotImplementedError`, suggesting that subclasses should implement this functionality. The `get_all_nodes` method returns a list of all nodes in the graph, while `get_all_nodes_by_label_list` filters and returns nodes based on their labels.

The `find_node` method searches for a node by its content and label. If such a node exists, it is returned; otherwise, the method returns None. The `batch_embedding` static method processes a list of nodes to generate embeddings for each node's content. It handles the limitation of the OpenAI API by batching requests into chunks of 16 contents at a time.

The `__str__` method provides a string representation of the graph, useful for debugging and logging purposes.

Note: The `add_node` method is not implemented in this base class and should be overridden in subclasses to provide specific behavior. Developers extending this class are expected to implement node addition logic tailored to their application's requirements.

Output Example: When calling `__str__()` on an instance of Graph with two nodes, the output might look like:
Graph(nodes={'node1': <Node object at 0x7f8b2c3d4e5f>, 'node2': <Node object at 0x7f8b2c3d4a90>})
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the Graph class.
parameters:
· path: A string or Path object representing the file path, or None if no specific file is associated with this graph.

Code Description: The __init__ method is the constructor for the Graph class. It initializes a new instance of the Graph with an optional parameter 'path'. This parameter can be either a string or a Path object that specifies the location of a file related to the graph, such as a data source from which nodes and edges might be loaded. If no path is provided (i.e., if the value is None), the graph will be initialized without any associated file.

The method initializes an empty dictionary 'nodes' which is intended to store information about the nodes in the graph. This setup allows for dynamic addition of nodes as needed during the lifecycle of the Graph instance.

After setting up the 'nodes' attribute, it calls super().__init__(path=path). This line suggests that the Graph class inherits from another class (likely a base class related to file handling or graph management), and it passes the 'path' parameter to the constructor of this superclass. This is typical in object-oriented programming when extending functionality of an existing class.

Note: Usage points include creating a new Graph instance without any specific file association by calling Graph() or initializing with a file path using Graph('path/to/graph_data.txt') or Graph(Path('path/to/graph_data.txt')). The latter approach might be preferred for better handling of file paths across different operating systems.
***
### FunctionDef size(self)
**size**: This function returns the number of nodes present in a graph.
parameters:
· None: The size function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The size method is defined within a class, likely representing a graph data structure. It calculates and returns the total count of nodes contained within the graph by utilizing Python's built-in len() function on the self.nodes attribute. This attribute presumably holds a collection (such as a list or set) of all node objects or identifiers in the graph.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to determine the scale or complexity of their graph data structure, such as for debugging purposes, performance analysis, or implementing algorithms that depend on the number of nodes.

Output Example: If the graph contains 10 nodes, calling size() would return 10.
***
### FunctionDef get_node(self, node_id)
**get_node**: This function retrieves a node from the graph based on its unique identifier.
parameters:
· node_id: A string representing the unique identifier of the node to be retrieved.

Code Description: The get_node method is designed to fetch a specific node from the graph data structure. It accepts a single argument, node_id, which is expected to be a string that uniquely identifies a node within the graph. The function uses this identifier to look up the corresponding Node object in the self.nodes dictionary. If a node with the specified ID exists, it returns that Node object; otherwise, it returns None.

Note: This method assumes that the graph's nodes are stored in a dictionary named self.nodes where keys are node identifiers (strings) and values are Node objects. Developers should ensure that the node_id provided matches one of the keys in this dictionary to retrieve the corresponding node successfully.

Output Example: If the graph contains a node with an ID "node123", calling get_node("node123") would return the Node object associated with that ID. If no such node exists, the function will return None.
***
### FunctionDef add_node(self)
**add_node**: This function is intended to add a node to a graph data structure within the knowledge management system. However, as it currently stands, the function raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that its implementation has not yet been completed.

parameters:
· **kwargs: Any - This parameter allows for any number of keyword arguments to be passed to the function. The specific keys and values expected would depend on how the function is intended to be implemented.

Code Description: Detailed analysis reveals that the current state of the add_node function does not perform any operations related to adding a node to a graph. Instead, it immediately raises a NotImplementedError. This suggests that while the function's purpose is clear (to add a node), its functionality has not been defined or coded yet. The use of **kwargs implies flexibility in how nodes might be added, potentially allowing for various attributes or properties to be assigned to each node.

Note: Usage points include understanding that at present, calling this function will result in an error as it is not implemented. Developers should wait for the implementation of this method before attempting to add nodes to a graph using this function. Additionally, once implemented, developers can expect to pass necessary parameters through **kwargs to define the node's properties and attributes effectively.
***
### FunctionDef get_all_nodes(self)
**get_all_nodes**: This function retrieves a list of all nodes present within a graph structure.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `get_all_nodes` method is designed to return a list containing all node objects stored within the graph's internal data structure. In this context, the graph maintains its nodes in a dictionary where keys are likely identifiers for each node and values are the node objects themselves. By calling `self.nodes.values()`, the function accesses all the node objects from this dictionary. The use of `list()` then converts these values into a list format, which is returned to the caller.

Note: This method assumes that the graph class has an attribute named `nodes` which is a dictionary mapping unique identifiers to node objects. It is important for users of this function to understand that the order of nodes in the resulting list may not correspond to any specific ordering criteria unless such an order is defined elsewhere in the graph implementation.

Output Example: If the graph contains three nodes with identifiers 'A', 'B', and 'C', the output might look like:
[Node(A), Node(B), Node(C)]
Here, `Node(A)`, `Node(B)`, and `Node(C)` represent the node objects associated with identifiers 'A', 'B', and 'C' respectively.
***
### FunctionDef get_all_nodes_by_label_list(self, label_list)
**get_all_nodes_by_label_list**: This function retrieves a list of nodes from a graph where each node's label is found within a specified list of labels.

parameters:
· label_list: A list of strings representing the labels for which nodes should be retrieved.

Code Description: The function iterates over all nodes stored in the `nodes` attribute of the Graph object. It checks if the label of each node exists in the provided `label_list`. If a match is found, the node is included in the resulting list that is returned by the function. This allows for efficient retrieval of multiple nodes based on their labels.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to filter and work with specific subsets of nodes within a graph structure based on predefined criteria (labels).

Output Example: If the graph contains nodes labeled 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D' and `label_list` is ['A', 'C'], the function will return a list containing the nodes labeled 'A' and 'C'.
***
### FunctionDef find_node(self, content, label)
**find_node**: This function searches through a collection of nodes to find a specific node based on its content and label.

parameters:
· content: A string representing the content of the node being searched for.
· label: A string representing the label of the node being searched for.

Code Description: The `find_node` method iterates over all nodes stored in the `nodes` dictionary. For each node, it checks if both the `content` and `label` attributes match the provided parameters. If a matching node is found, it returns that node object. If no such node exists after checking all nodes, the function returns `None`.

Note: This function is utilized within the `add_node` method of the `UndirectedGraph` class to check for existing nodes with identical content and label before adding new nodes or neighbors.

Output Example: Assuming there is a node in the graph with content "Introduction" and label "Chapter", calling `find_node("Introduction", "Chapter")` would return that specific node object. If no such node exists, it would return `None`.
***
### FunctionDef batch_embedding(nodes)
**batch_embedding**: This function processes a list of Node objects by generating embeddings for their content using an external API. It handles the batching of node contents to comply with the input length limitations of the API.

**parameters**:
· nodes: A list of Node objects, each containing content that needs to be embedded.

**Code Description**: The function starts by extracting the content from each Node in the provided list. It then defines a batch size (16) based on the maximum input length allowed by the OpenAI embedding API. The contents are processed in batches of this size to generate embeddings, which are collected into a list. An assertion checks that the number of nodes matches the number of generated embeddings, ensuring data integrity. Each Node is then updated with its corresponding embedding.

**Note**: This function assumes that the `APIBackend` class has a method `create_embedding` that takes an input_content parameter and returns a list of embeddings for the provided contents. The function modifies the original Node objects by adding an `embedding` attribute to each.

**Output Example**: If the input is a list of three Node objects with contents "Hello", "World", and "OpenAI", the output would be the same list of Node objects, but now each Node object will have an additional `embedding` attribute containing its respective embedding vector generated by the API.
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: This method returns a string representation of the Graph object, specifically detailing its nodes.
parameters:
· No parameters: The __str__ method does not accept any additional parameters beyond the implicit self parameter which refers to the instance of the class.

Code Description: The __str__ method is a special method in Python used to define a human-readable string representation of an object. In this context, it returns a formatted string that includes the nodes attribute of the Graph class. This allows for easy visualization and debugging by providing a clear output when the Graph object is printed or converted to a string.

Note: Usage points include printing the Graph object directly in code, which will invoke the __str__ method automatically, or using str() function on an instance of Graph to get its string representation.

Output Example: If a Graph object has nodes [1, 2, 3], calling print(graph_object) would output "Graph(nodes=[1, 2, 3])".
***
## ClassDef UndirectedGraph
**UndirectedGraph**: An undirected graph class where edges have no directionality. This class extends a base `Graph` class, adding specific functionality for managing nodes and their relationships without considering edge direction.

attributes:
· path: Optional parameter specifying the file path to load/save graph data.
· vector_base: An instance of `VectorBase`, used for storing node embeddings and performing semantic searches.

Code Description: The `UndirectedGraph` class is designed to manage an undirected graph, where nodes can be added with optional neighbors. It inherits from a base `Graph` class but implements specific methods tailored for undirected graphs. The constructor initializes the graph with an optional path parameter and sets up a vector base for embedding management.

The `add_node` method allows adding individual nodes to the graph, optionally linking them to another node (neighbor). Before adding a new node, it checks if a similar node already exists based on content or label. If such a node is found, it uses that instead of creating a new one. The method also handles neighbor addition similarly.

The `add_nodes` method simplifies the process of adding multiple nodes with their neighbors by iterating over a list of neighbors and calling `add_node` for each pair.

The `get_node` and `get_node_by_content` methods provide ways to retrieve nodes either by their unique identifier or by semantic similarity based on content. The latter uses a semantic search to find the closest matching node.

The `get_nodes_within_steps` method returns all nodes within a specified number of steps from a given start node, optionally filtering by labels and blocking certain types of nodes during traversal.

The `get_nodes_intersection` method finds the intersection of nodes reachable within a specified number of steps from multiple starting nodes. This is useful for finding common connections between different parts of the graph.

The `semantic_search` method performs a semantic search based on node embeddings, returning nodes whose similarity score exceeds a given threshold.

The `clear` method resets the graph by clearing all nodes and reinitializing the vector base.

The `query_by_node` and `query_by_content` methods allow querying the graph based on node connections or content similarity. They can also apply constraints such as maximum steps, required labels, and proximity to a constraint node.

Static methods like `intersection`, `different`, `cal_distance`, and `filter_label` provide utility functions for set operations, distance calculations, and filtering nodes by label.

Note: The class uses semantic embeddings for node comparison and search operations, which requires the nodes to have an embedding attribute. Developers should ensure that nodes are properly embedded before performing these operations.

Output Example: When calling `__str__()` on an instance of `UndirectedGraph` with two nodes, the output might look like:
UndirectedGraph(nodes={'node1': <UndirectedNode object at 0x7f8b2c3d4e5f>, 'node2': <UndirectedNode object at 0x7f8b2c3d4a90>})
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the UndirectedGraph class.
parameters:
· path: A string or Path object representing the file path to a graph data source, or None if no specific file is provided.

Code Description: The __init__ method is the constructor for the UndirectedGraph class. It accepts an optional parameter 'path', which can be either a string or a Path object indicating the location of a graph data source. If no path is specified (i.e., it defaults to None), the graph will be initialized without loading any external data.

Upon initialization, the method creates an instance of PDVectorBase and assigns it to the attribute 'vector_base'. This suggests that the UndirectedGraph class utilizes vector-based operations or representations internally, possibly for storing node embeddings or other numerical data associated with the graph nodes. The use of PDVectorBase implies a connection to pandas or similar data handling libraries, given the naming convention.

The call to super().__init__(path=path) indicates that the UndirectedGraph class inherits from another base class (not shown in the provided code snippet). This superclass is initialized with the same 'path' parameter, which likely handles the core graph structure and operations. By passing the path to the superclass constructor, the UndirectedGraph class leverages existing functionality for loading and managing graph data.

Note: Usage points include initializing an empty graph by not providing a path (e.g., `graph = UndirectedGraph()`), or initializing a graph with pre-existing data by specifying the file path (e.g., `graph = UndirectedGraph('data/graph_data.csv')`). This flexibility allows developers to either start from scratch or work with existing graph datasets.
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: This method returns a string representation of an UndirectedGraph object, specifically detailing its nodes.
parameters:
· None: The __str__ method does not accept any parameters directly; it operates on the instance attributes of the class.

Code Description: The __str__ method is a special method in Python used to define a human-readable string representation of an object. In this context, when an UndirectedGraph object is converted to a string (e.g., via print() or str()), the method returns a formatted string that includes the nodes contained within the graph. This is achieved using an f-string for formatting, where self.nodes refers to the attribute holding the list or set of nodes in the graph.

Note: The __str__ method is particularly useful for debugging and logging purposes as it provides a quick way to inspect the contents of an object without needing to delve into its internal structure. It enhances readability and maintainability of code by allowing developers to easily understand what data an object holds at a glance.

Output Example: If an UndirectedGraph object has nodes [1, 2, 3], calling str() on this object or using print() would output:
UndirectedGraph(nodes=[1, 2, 3])
***
### FunctionDef add_node(self, node, neighbor, same_node_threshold)
**add_node**: This function adds a node to an undirected graph and optionally connects it to another node (neighbor). It checks if the node already exists based on its ID, content, and label before adding it to avoid duplicates. If a neighbor is provided, it also ensures that the neighbor is added to the graph and establishes a bidirectional connection between the two nodes.

**parameters**:
· node: An instance of UndirectedNode representing the node to be added to the graph.
· neighbor: An optional parameter; if provided, it should be an instance of UndirectedNode representing another node in the graph that will be connected to the newly added node. If not provided, no additional connections are made.
· same_node_threshold: A float value used for determining similarity between nodes (currently unused in the function). It is set to 0.95 by default.

**Code Description**: The `add_node` method begins by checking if a node with the same ID already exists in the graph using the `get_node` method. If such a node is found, it uses this existing node instead of creating a new one. If no node with the same ID is found, it then checks for an existing node with identical content and label using the `find_node` method. If a match is found, it uses that node; otherwise, it creates a new embedding for the node (using `create_embedding`), adds it to the vector base (`vector_base.add(document=node)`), and updates the graph's nodes dictionary.

If a neighbor is provided, the function performs similar checks to ensure the neighbor is either an existing node in the graph or a new node that needs to be added. Once both the node and its neighbor are properly handled (either retrieved from the graph or newly added), it establishes a bidirectional connection between them using the `add_neighbor` method of the UndirectedNode class.

**Note**: This function is essential for dynamically building an undirected graph by adding nodes and their connections. It ensures that no duplicate nodes are created based on unique identifiers, content, and labels. Additionally, it supports the addition of neighbors to form relationships between nodes, which is crucial for representing complex data structures in graph form. When using this function, ensure that both `node` and `neighbor` (if provided) are valid instances of UndirectedNode.
***
### FunctionDef add_nodes(self, node, neighbors)
**add_nodes**: This function adds a node to an undirected graph and optionally connects it to multiple neighbors. It leverages the `add_node` method to handle individual nodes and their connections, ensuring that no duplicate nodes are added based on unique identifiers, content, and labels.

**parameters**:
· node: An instance of UndirectedNode representing the node to be added to the graph.
· neighbors: A list of UndirectedNode instances representing other nodes in the graph that will be connected to the newly added node. If the list is empty, no additional connections are made.

**Code Description**: The `add_nodes` method starts by checking if the `neighbors` list is empty. If it is, the function simply calls `self.add_node(node)` to add the node without any connections. If there are neighbors provided in the list, the function iterates over each neighbor and calls `self.add_node(node, neighbor=neighbor)`. This ensures that the main node is added to the graph and then connected bidirectionally with each of its specified neighbors using the `add_neighbor` method of the UndirectedNode class.

The use of the `add_node` method within `add_nodes` allows for the handling of duplicate nodes gracefully. If a node or neighbor already exists in the graph (based on ID, content, and label), it uses the existing instance instead of creating a new one. This prevents duplication and maintains consistency across the graph.

**Note**: This function is useful for adding a single node along with its connections to multiple neighbors in an undirected graph. It simplifies the process by handling each neighbor individually through the `add_node` method, which ensures that all nodes are added correctly and connected appropriately. When using this function, ensure that both `node` and each element in the `neighbors` list are valid instances of UndirectedNode.
***
### FunctionDef get_node(self, node_id)
**get_node**: Retrieves a node from an undirected graph based on its unique identifier.
parameters:
· node_id: A string representing the unique identifier of the node to be retrieved.

Code Description: The function `get_node` is designed to fetch a specific node from within an undirected graph. It accepts a single parameter, `node_id`, which serves as the unique key for identifying the desired node. Internally, it utilizes a dictionary (`self.nodes`) where keys are node identifiers and values are instances of `UndirectedNode`. The function leverages the dictionary's get method to return the corresponding `UndirectedNode` object associated with the provided `node_id`. If no node exists with the specified identifier, the function will return `None`.

Note: This function is crucial for accessing specific nodes within a graph structure, enabling further operations such as retrieving node attributes, managing connections (neighbors), or performing graph traversals. It assumes that each node in the graph has been uniquely identified and stored in the `self.nodes` dictionary.

Output Example: 
UndirectedNode(id='12345', label='example_label', content='This is an example node content...', neighbors={UndirectedNode(id='67890', ...), UndirectedNode(id='54321', ...)})
***
### FunctionDef get_node_by_content(self, content)
**get_node_by_content**: This function retrieves a node from an undirected graph based on its content by performing a semantic search. It returns the first node found whose content matches the input string within a high similarity threshold, or None if no such node exists.

parameters:
· content: A string representing the main data or information stored within the node that you are searching for.

Code Description: The function starts by checking if the provided `content` is equal to the string "Model". If it is, the function does nothing and proceeds to the next step. It then performs a semantic search using the `semantic_search` method of the graph object, passing in the `content` as the node parameter and setting a high similarity threshold (0.999). This ensures that only nodes with content extremely similar to the input string are considered matches. If any matches are found, the function returns the first match from the list of results. If no matches are found, it returns None.

Note: The function is designed to find nodes based on semantic similarity rather than exact content matching. The high similarity threshold (0.999) suggests that the function expects very close matches between the input string and node content. This can be useful in scenarios where slight variations in wording or formatting might exist but the core meaning remains the same.

Output Example: 
If a node with content "Model of an undirected graph" exists in the graph and has a semantic similarity score greater than 0.999 when compared to the input string, the function would return:
UndirectedNode(id=12345, label='example_label', content='Model of an undirected graph...', neighbors={UndirectedNode(id=67890, ...), UndirectedNode(id=54321, ...)})
If no such node exists or if the similarity score is below 0.999 for all nodes, the function would return:
None

### FunctionDef get_nodes_within_steps(self, start_node, steps, constraint_labels)
**get_nodes_within_steps**: Retrieves nodes within a specified number of steps from a given start node in an undirected graph, optionally filtering by labels and blocking traversal through certain types of nodes.

parameters:
· start_node: The starting node from which to find other nodes. It is an instance of the UndirectedNode class.
· steps: An integer indicating the maximum distance (in terms of edges) from the start node within which to search for connected nodes. Defaults to 1.
· constraint_labels: A list of strings representing labels that nodes must have to be included in the result. If provided, only nodes with these labels will be considered. Defaults to None.
· block: A boolean flag indicating whether traversal should be blocked through nodes not having any of the specified constraint_labels. When set to True, traversal is restricted to nodes matching the constraint_labels. Defaults to False.

Code Description: The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the start_node to find all connected nodes within the specified number of steps. It uses a queue to manage the exploration process and a visited set to keep track of already processed nodes, ensuring that each node is only processed once. Nodes are added to the result list if they have not been visited before and their distance from the start_node does not exceed the specified number of steps.

The function also supports optional filtering based on node labels through the constraint_labels parameter. If this parameter is provided, the function will only include nodes in the result that match one of the specified labels. Additionally, when block is set to True, traversal will be restricted to nodes with labels included in constraint_labels, effectively blocking paths through nodes not having these labels.

After collecting all qualifying nodes, the function removes the start_node from the result list (if it was included) and returns the final list of nodes.

Note: This function is useful for exploring local neighborhoods within a graph, filtering by node attributes, and controlling traversal behavior based on specific conditions. It can be used in various applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and more.

Output Example: 
[UndirectedNode(id='67890', label='example_label_1', content='This is an example node content...', neighbors={...}), UndirectedNode(id='54321', label='example_label_2', content='Another example node content...', neighbors={...})]
***
### FunctionDef get_nodes_intersection(self, nodes, steps, constraint_labels)
**get_nodes_intersection**: This function identifies nodes that are within a specified number of steps from each node in a given list of nodes, considering optional label constraints. It computes the intersection of these sets of nodes to find common nodes reachable from all provided starting nodes.

parameters:
· nodes: A list of UndirectedNode objects representing the starting points for finding connected nodes.
· steps: An integer indicating the maximum number of edges (steps) to traverse from each node in the list to find connected nodes. Defaults to 1.
· constraint_labels: An optional list of strings specifying labels that nodes must have to be included in the result. If provided, only nodes with these labels will be considered.

Code Description: The function first ensures that there are at least two nodes in the input list by asserting a minimum length requirement. It initializes an intersection variable as None. For each node in the input list, it retrieves all connected nodes within the specified number of steps using the get_nodes_within_steps method, applying any label constraints if provided. If this is the first iteration (intersection is None), it sets the intersection to the retrieved nodes. For subsequent iterations, it updates the intersection by computing the common nodes between the current intersection and the newly retrieved nodes using the intersection method. This process continues until all nodes in the input list have been processed, resulting in a final list of nodes that are reachable from all starting nodes within the specified number of steps and meet any label constraints.

Note: The function is useful for finding common neighbors or connected components shared among multiple nodes in an undirected graph, with optional filtering based on node labels. It can be applied in scenarios such as social network analysis to find mutual connections between groups of individuals.

Output Example: If the input list contains two nodes, nodeA and nodeB, and both are within 2 steps of a common node nodeC (and optionally match any specified label constraints), the function will return [nodeC]. This indicates that nodeC is reachable from both nodeA and nodeB within 2 steps and meets any provided label criteria.
***
### FunctionDef semantic_search(self, node, similarity_threshold, topk_k)
**semantic_search**: This function performs a semantic search within an undirected graph based on node embeddings. It identifies nodes whose embedding similarity to a given node exceeds a specified threshold.

parameters:
· node: An instance of UndirectedNode or a string representing the content of a node. If a string is provided, it will be converted into an UndirectedNode with that content.
· similarity_threshold: A float value indicating the minimum similarity score required for a node to be included in the results. Nodes with a distance score greater than this threshold are returned.
· topk_k: An integer specifying the maximum number of nodes to return from the search results.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the provided `node` is a string. If it is, it creates an UndirectedNode instance using that string as the content. It then calls the `search` method on the graph's vector base, passing in the node's content, the desired number of top results (`topk_k`), and the similarity threshold. The search method returns a list of documents (nodes) and their corresponding scores based on semantic similarity. Finally, the function retrieves each document's full UndirectedNode object using its ID via the `get_node` method and returns these nodes as a list.

Note: This function is useful for finding semantically similar nodes within a graph, which can be particularly helpful in knowledge management systems where understanding relationships between concepts or entities based on their content is crucial. The similarity threshold allows for filtering out less relevant results, while the `topk_k` parameter limits the number of returned results to manage output size.

Output Example: 
[UndirectedNode(id='12345', label='example_label', content='This is an example node content...', neighbors={UndirectedNode(id='67890', ...), UndirectedNode(id='54321', ...)}),
 UndirectedNode(id='67890', label='another_label', content='Another piece of node content...', neighbors={UndirectedNode(id='12345', ...)})]
***
### FunctionDef clear(self)
**clear**: This function resets an undirected graph by clearing its nodes and reinitializing its vector base to a new instance of PDVectorBase.
parameters:
· None: The clear function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `clear` method is designed to reset the state of an undirected graph object. It performs two primary actions:

1. **Clearing Nodes**: The method first calls the `clear()` method on `self.nodes`. Assuming that `nodes` is a collection (such as a list or set) that holds all the nodes in the graph, this operation removes all elements from the collection, effectively deleting all nodes from the graph.

2. **Reinitializing Vector Base**: After clearing the nodes, the function reassigns `self.vector_base` to a new instance of `PDVectorBase`. This implies that any previous state or data stored within the vector base is discarded and replaced with a fresh instance. The purpose of this step could be to reset any vector-related computations or storage associated with the graph.

**Note**: Usage points.
Developers should use the `clear` method when they need to completely reset an undirected graph, removing all nodes and resetting any vector-based data structures. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a graph needs to be reused for different datasets without creating a new object, thus saving memory and potentially improving performance by avoiding the overhead of object creation. Beginners should ensure that they understand the implications of calling `clear`, as it will erase all existing data within the graph, requiring them to rebuild the graph from scratch if necessary.
***
### FunctionDef query_by_node(self, node, step, constraint_labels, constraint_node, constraint_distance)
**query_by_node**: This function searches an undirected graph starting from a specified node to find other nodes within a given number of steps, optionally filtering by labels and blocking traversal through certain types of nodes. It also supports additional constraints based on proximity to another node.

parameters:
· node: The starting node for the search, an instance of UndirectedNode.
· step: An integer indicating the maximum distance (in terms of edges) from the start node within which to search for connected nodes. Defaults to 1.
· constraint_labels: A list of strings representing labels that nodes must have to be included in the result. If provided, only nodes with these labels will be considered. Defaults to None.
· constraint_node: An optional UndirectedNode instance. If specified, the function checks if any node in the search results is within a certain distance from this node based on their embeddings.
· constraint_distance: A float representing the maximum allowed cosine distance between nodes in the search results and the constraint_node. Only nodes with a cosine distance less than or equal to this value are included in the final result. Defaults to 0.
· block: A boolean flag indicating whether traversal should be blocked through nodes not having any of the specified constraint_labels. When set to True, traversal is restricted to nodes matching the constraint_labels. Defaults to False.

Code Description: The function begins by calling get_nodes_within_steps with the provided parameters to retrieve a list of nodes within the specified number of steps from the start node. If constraint_node is not None, it iterates through these nodes and checks their cosine distance to the constraint_node using cal_distance. Nodes that exceed the constraint_distance are excluded from the final result. If no nodes meet the criteria, an empty list is returned. Otherwise, the function returns the filtered list of nodes.

Note: This function is useful for exploring local neighborhoods within a graph while applying specific constraints on node labels and proximity to another node based on their embeddings. It can be used in various applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and more.

Output Example: Assuming a search starting from an UndirectedNode with id '12345', the function might return a list of nodes like this:
[UndirectedNode(id='67890', label='example_label_1', content='This is an example node content...', neighbors={...}), UndirectedNode(id='54321', label='example_label_2', content='Another example node content...', neighbors={...})]
These nodes are within the specified number of steps from the start node, meet any provided label constraints, and if a constraint_node was given, they are also within the allowed cosine distance from it.
***
### FunctionDef query_by_content(self, content, topk_k, step, constraint_labels, constraint_node, similarity_threshold, constraint_distance)
**query_by_content**: This function searches an undirected graph to find nodes whose content is similar to a given query or queries, while also considering their connection relationships within the graph. It returns a list of up to `topk_k` nodes that match the criteria. If no nodes meet the constraints, it returns an empty list.

**parameters**:
· content: A string or a list of strings representing the search query or queries.
· topk_k: An integer specifying the maximum number of nodes to return from the search results. Defaults to 5.
· step: An integer indicating the maximum distance (in terms of edges) from the start node within which to search for connected nodes. Defaults to 1.
· constraint_labels: A list of strings representing labels that nodes must have to be included in the result. If provided, only nodes with these labels will be considered. Defaults to None.
· constraint_node: An optional UndirectedNode instance. If specified, the function checks if any node in the search results is within a certain distance from this node based on their embeddings. Defaults to None.
· similarity_threshold: A float value indicating the minimum similarity score required for a node to be included in the results. Nodes with a distance score greater than this threshold are returned. Defaults to 0.0.
· constraint_distance: A float representing the maximum allowed cosine distance between nodes in the search results and the `constraint_node`. Only nodes with a cosine distance less than or equal to this value are included in the final result. Defaults to 0.
· block: A boolean flag indicating whether traversal should be blocked through nodes not having any of the specified `constraint_labels`. When set to True, traversal is restricted to nodes matching the `constraint_labels`. Defaults to False.

**Code Description**: The function first checks if the provided content is a string and converts it into a list containing that single string if necessary. It then iterates over each query in the content list. For each query, it performs a semantic search using the `semantic_search` method to find nodes whose embeddings are similar to the query, based on the specified similarity threshold and topk_k parameter.

The function retrieves a list of similar nodes for each query and then uses the `query_by_node` method to find connected nodes within the specified number of steps from these similar nodes. It applies any provided constraints such as labels, proximity to another node (`constraint_node`), and whether traversal should be blocked through certain types of nodes.

The function collects all valid connected nodes across different queries, ensuring no duplicates are included in the final result list. If the total number of collected nodes exceeds `topk_k`, it truncates the list to include only the top `topk_k` nodes. The resulting list is then returned.

**Note**: This function is useful for finding semantically similar nodes within a graph while also considering their connection relationships and applying specific constraints on node labels, proximity to another node based on embeddings, and traversal rules.

**Output Example**: Assuming a search with the content "example query", the function might return a list of nodes like this:
[UndirectedNode(id='12345', label='example_label_1', content='This is an example node content...', neighbors={...}), UndirectedNode(id='67890', label='example_label_2', content='Another example node content...', neighbors={...})]
These nodes are semantically similar to the query, within the specified number of steps from the start node, meet any provided label constraints, and if a `constraint_node` was given, they are also within the allowed cosine distance from it.
***
### FunctionDef intersection(nodes1, nodes2)
**intersection**: This function computes the intersection of two lists of UndirectedNode objects, returning a list containing only those nodes that appear in both input lists.

parameters:
· nodes1: A list of UndirectedNode objects representing the first set of nodes.
· nodes2: A list of UndirectedNode objects representing the second set of nodes.

Code Description: The function iterates over each node in the first list (nodes1) and checks if it is also present in the second list (nodes2). If a node from nodes1 is found in nodes2, it is included in the resulting list. This process effectively finds common nodes between the two input lists based on their identity.

Note: The function relies on the equality comparison of UndirectedNode objects, which typically compares object identities unless overridden. Therefore, for accurate intersection results, ensure that the nodes being compared are indeed the same instances or have an appropriate __eq__ method defined to compare node attributes like content and label.

Output Example: If nodes1 contains [nodeA, nodeB, nodeC] and nodes2 contains [nodeB, nodeD], the function will return [nodeB]. This output indicates that nodeB is the only node present in both input lists.
***
### FunctionDef different(nodes1, nodes2)
**different**: This function computes the symmetric difference between two lists of UndirectedNode objects. The symmetric difference is a set operation that returns elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.

parameters:
· nodes1: A list containing instances of UndirectedNode. These nodes represent one set for comparison.
· nodes2: Another list containing instances of UndirectedNode, representing the second set for comparison.

Code Description: The function starts by converting both input lists (nodes1 and nodes2) into sets. This conversion is necessary because set operations like symmetric difference are not directly applicable to lists in Python. After converting the lists to sets, the function applies the symmetric_difference method, which returns a new set containing elements that are unique to each of the original sets. Finally, this resulting set is converted back into a list before being returned.

Note: The order of nodes in the output list is not guaranteed because sets do not maintain any specific order. Also, since the function relies on set operations, it assumes that the UndirectedNode objects can be compared for equality and hashed, which is typically true if they have unique identifiers or content.

Output Example: Suppose we have two lists of UndirectedNodes:

list1 = [UndirectedNode(content="node1"), UndirectedNode(content="node2")]
list2 = [UndirectedNode(content="node2"), UndirectedNode(content="node3")]

Calling different(list1, list2) would return a list containing nodes that are unique to each list. Assuming the nodes can be uniquely identified by their content, the output might look like:

[UndirectedNode(id=..., label='', content='node1', neighbors=set()), 
 UndirectedNode(id=..., label='', content='node3', neighbors=set())]

The exact id values and other attributes would depend on how the UndirectedNodes were instantiated.
***
### FunctionDef cal_distance(node1, node2)
**cal_distance**: Computes the cosine distance between two nodes based on their embedding vectors.
parameters:
· node1: An instance of UndirectedNode representing the first node for comparison.
· node2: An instance of UndirectedNode representing the second node for comparison.

Code Description: The function cal_distance calculates and returns the cosine similarity between the embedding attributes of two given UndirectedNode instances. It leverages a cosine distance calculation, which is typically used to measure the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space. In this context, the embeddings are treated as vectors, and their cosine similarity indicates how similar the nodes are based on their embedded representations.

Note: This function assumes that both node1 and node2 have valid embedding attributes (i.e., they are not None). The cosine distance is a common metric in machine learning for comparing vector-based data, such as word embeddings or other feature vectors. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 means the vectors are identical, 0 indicates orthogonality (no similarity), and -1 signifies diametrically opposed vectors.

Output Example: Assuming node1 has an embedding of [1, 2] and node2 has an embedding of [3, 4], the function would return a float value representing their cosine similarity. For these embeddings, the output might be approximately 0.9897, indicating high similarity between the nodes based on their embeddings.
***
### FunctionDef filter_label(nodes, labels)
**filter_label**: This function filters a list of UndirectedNode instances based on specified labels.
parameters:
· nodes: A list of UndirectedNode objects that need to be filtered.
· labels: A list of string labels used as criteria for filtering the nodes.

Code Description: The filter_label function takes two parameters, a list of UndirectedNode objects and a list of labels. It returns a new list containing only those UndirectedNode instances whose label attribute matches one of the strings in the provided labels list. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over each node in the nodes list and checks if its label is present in the labels list.

Note: The function assumes that both inputs are correctly formatted, i.e., nodes should be a list of UndirectedNode objects and labels should be a list of strings. If any node does not have a label that matches one of those specified in the labels list, it will not appear in the returned list.

Output Example: Suppose we have a list of UndirectedNode instances with various labels such as 'example', 'test', and 'sample'. If we call filter_label(nodes=[node1, node2, node3], labels=['example', 'sample']), where node1 has label 'example' and node3 has label 'sample', the function will return [node1, node3]. Node2, which might have a different label like 'test', would be excluded from the result.
***
## FunctionDef graph_to_edges(graph)
**graph_to_edges**: This function converts a graph represented as an adjacency list into a list of unique edges.

parameters:
· graph: A dictionary where each key is a node, and its value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it (neighbors).

Code Description: The function iterates over each node in the provided graph. For every neighbor associated with a node, it checks if an edge between the current node and the neighbor already exists in the edges list, considering both possible directions ((node, neighbor) and (neighbor, node)). If such an edge does not exist, it adds the new edge as a tuple to the edges list. This ensures that each edge is only added once, maintaining uniqueness.

Note: The function assumes that the graph is undirected, meaning if there is an edge from node A to node B, then there should also be an edge from node B to node A in the adjacency list representation. If the graph were directed, additional logic would be needed to handle edges in one direction only.

Output Example: Given a graph represented as {'A': ['B', 'C'], 'B': ['A', 'D'], 'C': ['A'], 'D': ['B']}, the function would return [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'D')]. Note that the edge ('B', 'A') is not included because it is considered a duplicate of ('A', 'B').
## FunctionDef assign_random_coordinate_to_node(nodes, scope, origin)
**assign_random_coordinate_to_node**: This function assigns random 2D coordinates to a list of nodes within a specified scope around an origin point.

parameters:
· nodes: A list of strings, where each string represents a node that needs to be assigned a coordinate.
· scope: A float value defining the range in which the random coordinates can vary from the origin. The default value is 1.0.
· origin: A tuple of two floats representing the x and y coordinates of the origin point around which the random coordinates will be generated. The default value is (0.0, 0.0).

Code Description: The function initializes an empty dictionary named 'coordinates' to store node names as keys and their corresponding coordinate tuples as values. It iterates over each node in the provided list of nodes. For each node, it generates a random x-coordinate by using `random.SystemRandom().uniform(0, scope)` which returns a random float number between 0 and the specified 'scope'. This value is then adjusted by adding the x-component of the origin to ensure the coordinate falls within the desired range relative to the origin. The same process is repeated for generating the y-coordinate. After generating both coordinates for a node, they are stored in the dictionary with the node name as the key. Once all nodes have been processed and assigned their respective coordinates, the function returns the 'coordinates' dictionary.

Note: This function uses `random.SystemRandom()` which provides access to the most secure source of randomness that your operating system provides, making it suitable for cryptographic purposes or when higher quality randomness is required compared to the standard `random.random()` function. The scope and origin parameters allow flexibility in defining the area within which the coordinates are generated.

Output Example: If the input list of nodes is ['node1', 'node2'], with a scope of 5.0, and an origin at (1.0, 1.0), the output could be:
{'node1': (3.456789, 4.123456), 'node2': (5.009876, 2.345678)}
Note that the actual values will vary due to randomness.
## FunctionDef assign_isometric_coordinate_to_node(nodes, x_step, x_origin, y_origin)
**assign_isometric_coordinate_to_node**: This function assigns isometric coordinates to a list of nodes based on specified parameters for spacing and origin.

parameters:
· nodes: A list containing node identifiers (can be any hashable type, such as integers or strings) that will receive coordinate assignments.
· x_step: A float representing the horizontal distance between each node's assigned coordinate. Defaults to 1.0 if not provided.
· x_origin: A float indicating the starting x-coordinate from which nodes' coordinates are calculated. Defaults to 0.0 if not specified.
· y_origin: A float specifying the common y-coordinate for all nodes, as this function assigns a fixed y-value to each node. Defaults to 0.0 if not provided.

Code Description: The function initializes an empty dictionary named 'coordinates'. It then iterates over the list of nodes using their index and value. For each node, it calculates its x-coordinate by adding the product of the current index (i) and the specified horizontal step size (x_step) to the starting x-origin. The y-coordinate remains constant for all nodes at the value of y_origin. Each node is then mapped to a tuple containing its calculated (x, y) coordinates in the 'coordinates' dictionary. Finally, the function returns this dictionary.

Note: This function assumes an isometric layout where all nodes share the same y-coordinate but are spaced out horizontally according to their position in the list and the specified x_step value. It does not account for any vertical spacing or adjustments that might be necessary in a true isometric projection.

Output Example: If the input parameters are `nodes=['A', 'B', 'C']`, `x_step=2.0`, `x_origin=1.0`, and `y_origin=3.0`, the function will return:
`{'A': (1.0, 3.0), 'B': (3.0, 3.0), 'C': (5.0, 3.0)}`

This output indicates that node 'A' is placed at coordinates (1.0, 3.0), node 'B' at (3.0, 3.0), and node 'C' at (5.0, 3.0).
## FunctionDef curly_node_coordinate(coordinates, center_y, r)
**curly_node_coordinate**: This function adjusts the y-coordinates of nodes in a given dictionary to form a circular arc above a specified center line, assuming the x-coordinates remain unchanged. The curvature is limited to less than 90 degrees.

**parameters**:
· coordinates: A dictionary where keys are node identifiers and values are tuples representing (x, y) coordinates.
· center_y: A float indicating the y-coordinate of the circle's center from which the arc will be drawn. Defaults to 1.0.
· r: A float representing the radius of the circular arc. Defaults to 1.0.

**Code Description**: The function iterates over each node in the provided dictionary, recalculating its y-coordinate based on a circular equation. The new y-coordinate is determined by solving for y in the circle's equation x^2 + (y - m)^2 = r^2, where m is the center_y parameter and r is the radius. This transformation ensures that all nodes lie on a semicircular arc above the line y = center_y.

**Note**: The function assumes that the input coordinates are such that the resulting circle does not exceed 90 degrees of curvature from the vertical axis passing through (x, center_y). If x-values extend beyond ±r, the square root operation will result in a complex number, which is not handled by this function. Users should ensure that all x-values are within the range [-r, r].

**Output Example**: Given coordinates = {'node1': (-0.5, 0), 'node2': (0.5, 0)}, center_y = 1.0, and r = 1.0, the function will return a dictionary with updated y-values for each node that lie on a semicircle centered at (0, 1) with radius 1. The output might look like {'node1': (-0.5, 1.866), 'node2': (0.5, 1.866)}, where the y-values are calculated to satisfy the circle equation for their respective x-values.
