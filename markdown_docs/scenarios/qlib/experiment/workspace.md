## ClassDef QlibFBWorkspace
**QlibFBWorkspace**: This class extends FBWorkspace to provide a specialized workspace for executing Qlib backtests using Docker environments. It initializes by injecting code from a specified template folder and includes methods to execute backtests, read results, and log outputs.

attributes:
· template_folder_path: A Path object representing the directory containing the necessary templates or scripts required for setting up the Qlib environment.
· qlib_config_name: A string specifying the name of the configuration file used by Qlib for running the backtest. Defaults to "conf.yaml".
· run_env: A dictionary that can be used to pass additional environment variables to the Docker container during execution.

Code Description: The class starts by calling the constructor of its parent class, FBWorkspace, and then injects code from a specified folder into the workspace. This setup is crucial for preparing the environment with all necessary scripts and configurations before running any backtests.

The `execute` method sets up a QTDockerEnv object, which is responsible for managing Docker environments specifically tailored for quantitative trading tasks. It prepares the Docker environment by calling its `prepare` method. Following this preparation, it runs two commands within the Docker container: first, it executes a Qlib backtest using the specified configuration file and any additional environment variables provided; second, it reads the results of the backtest from a Python script.

After running these commands, the method attempts to read a pickle file named "ret.pkl" located in the workspace path. This file is expected to contain the return data from the backtest, which is then logged with a specific tag for reference. The method also checks for the existence of a CSV file named "qlib_res.csv". If this file does not exist, an error is logged, and the method returns None. Otherwise, it reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, selects the first column (assuming it contains relevant backtest results), and returns these results.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the specified template folder contains all necessary scripts and configurations for Qlib to run successfully within the Docker environment. Additionally, users should verify that the configuration file name matches the one used in the `execute` method call or provide a different name if needed.

Output Example: A pandas Series object containing backtest results from the CSV file "qlib_res.csv". For instance, it might look like this:

2019-01-01    0.005
2019-01-02   -0.003
2019-01-03    0.007
...
Freq: B, Name: strategy_returns, dtype: float64

This output represents the daily returns of a trading strategy as computed by Qlib during the backtest.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, template_folder_path)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of QlibFBWorkspace by setting up the workspace using a specified template folder path.

parameters:
· template_folder_path: A Path object representing the directory containing the template files to be injected into the workspace.
· *args: Variable length argument list passed to the superclass constructor.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments passed to the superclass constructor.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that is called when an instance of the class is created. In this case, it initializes a new QlibFBWorkspace object. It first calls the constructor of its superclass using super().__init__(*args, **kwargs), allowing any initialization logic defined in the parent class to be executed with the provided arguments.

Following the call to the superclass constructor, the method proceeds to inject code from the specified template folder into the workspace by invoking self.inject_code_from_folder(template_folder_path). This suggests that the QlibFBWorkspace class has a mechanism for dynamically incorporating code or configuration files located in the given directory path into its operational environment.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the provided template_folder_path is correct and accessible, as well as understanding any specific requirements or configurations expected by the inject_code_from_folder method. Developers should also be aware of how this initialization process integrates with other parts of the QlibFBWorkspace class to ensure proper functionality.

### FunctionDef execute(self, qlib_config_name, run_env)
**execute**: This function prepares a Docker environment using QTDockerEnv, runs a Qlib backtest specified by a configuration file, processes the results, logs them, and returns a specific column from the resulting CSV file.

parameters:
· qlib_config_name: A string representing the name of the Qlib configuration file to be used for the backtest. Defaults to "conf.yaml".
· run_env: A dictionary containing environment variables that will be passed to the Docker container during execution. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
· *args, **kwargs: Additional positional and keyword arguments that can be passed but are not utilized within this function.

Code Description: The function starts by creating an instance of QTDockerEnv, which is responsible for setting up a Docker environment suitable for running quantitative finance experiments. It then prepares the Docker environment using the `prepare` method.

Next, it runs the Qlib backtest inside the Docker container. This is achieved by calling the `run` method on the QTDockerEnv instance with parameters specifying the local path to the workspace, the command to execute (which includes running qrun with the specified configuration file), and any environment variables that need to be set.

After the backtest completes, the function runs another command inside the Docker container to process the results. This is done by executing a Python script named `read_exp_res.py` within the same Docker environment.

The function then reads a pickle file named "ret.pkl" from the workspace path and logs its contents using a logger with a tag indicating that it contains data for a quantitative backtesting chart.

Following this, the function checks if a CSV file named "qlib_res.csv" exists in the workspace. If the file does not exist, an error is logged, and the function returns None. If the file does exist, the function reads the CSV into a pandas DataFrame, selects the first column (index 0), and returns it.

Note: The function assumes that certain files ("ret.pkl", "qlib_res.csv") are generated as part of the backtest process and are located in the workspace directory. Developers should ensure these files are correctly produced by their Qlib configuration and scripts.

Output Example: Assuming "qlib_res.csv" contains data with multiple columns, the function would return a pandas Series representing the first column of this CSV file. For example:

2021-01-04    0.0015
2021-01-05    -0.0003
2021-01-06    0.0027
Name: strategy_returns, dtype: float64
