## ClassDef QlibFactorExperiment
**QlibFactorExperiment**: This class represents a specialized factor experiment within the Qlib framework, inheriting from the more general FactorExperiment class. It is designed to facilitate experiments related to financial factors using the Qlib library's functionalities.

attributes:
· *args: Variable length argument list passed to the parent class constructor.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor.

Code Description: The QlibFactorExperiment class initializes by calling its superclass (FactorExperiment) constructor with any positional and keyword arguments it receives. This setup allows for flexibility in how instances of QlibFactorExperiment are created, accommodating various configurations that might be necessary for different experiments. After initializing the base class, the constructor sets up an experiment workspace specific to Qlib factors. The workspace is instantiated as a QlibFBWorkspace object, which uses a template folder located relative to the file where this class is defined (specifically, in a subdirectory named "factor_template"). This template folder likely contains predefined configurations or files that are essential for setting up and running factor experiments within the Qlib environment.

Note: Usage points include creating instances of QlibFactorExperiment when conducting financial factor analysis using Qlib. Developers should ensure that the "factor_template" directory exists and is correctly configured with necessary templates and settings to support their specific experimental needs. This class provides a structured approach to leveraging Qlib's capabilities for factor-based research, making it easier to manage experiments and analyze results within this specialized domain.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the QlibFactorExperiment class, setting up the experiment workspace using a specified template folder path.
parameters:
· *args: Variable length argument list passed to the superclass constructor.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments passed to the superclass constructor.

Code Description: The __init__ method is the constructor for the QlibFactorExperiment class. It begins by invoking the constructor of its superclass with all positional and keyword arguments it receives, ensuring that any initialization logic in the parent class is executed. Following this, it initializes an attribute named experiment_workspace. This attribute is instantiated as an object of QlibFBWorkspace, a class presumably responsible for managing the workspace environment specific to factor experiments within the qlib framework. The template folder path for this workspace is set to the directory containing the current file (where __init__ is defined) concatenated with "factor_template". This setup suggests that the factor experiment will utilize predefined templates located in the specified directory for its operations.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that any necessary arguments required by the superclass are correctly provided when creating an instance of QlibFactorExperiment. Additionally, developers should be aware that the functionality and behavior of this class depend on the correct implementation and availability of the QlibFBWorkspace class and the templates located in the "factor_template" directory.

## ClassDef QlibFactorScenario
**QlibFactorScenario**: This class represents a scenario specifically designed for factor experiments within the Qlib framework. It inherits from a base `Scenario` class and initializes several attributes that provide detailed information about the background, source data, output format, interface guidelines, simulator usage, rich style description, and experiment settings relevant to conducting factor experiments.

**attributes**:
· _background: A string containing the background information of the scenario.
· _source_data: A string describing the available source data for the task.
· _output_format: A string detailing the required format for the output produced by the code.
· _interface: A string outlining the interface or guidelines that should be followed when writing runnable code.
· _simulator: A string providing information about the simulator that can be used to test the factor.
· _rich_style_description: A string offering a richly styled description of the scenario, likely for display purposes.
· _experiment_setting: A string containing settings specific to conducting the experiment.

**Code Description**: The `QlibFactorScenario` class initializes its attributes by deep copying predefined dictionaries from `prompt_dict`. These dictionaries contain essential information about different aspects of the factor experiment. Properties are defined for accessing these attributes, ensuring encapsulation and controlled access. The method `get_source_data_desc` returns a description of the source data that can be used in the task, optionally taking a `Task` object as an argument. The `get_scenario_all_desc` method provides a comprehensive description of the scenario, including background information, source data, interface guidelines, output format, and simulator details. It accepts optional parameters to customize the returned description.

**Note**: Usage points include initializing an instance of `QlibFactorScenario` to retrieve detailed descriptions about various aspects of the factor experiment setup. This can be particularly useful for developers who are setting up or debugging experiments within the Qlib framework.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value from `get_scenario_all_desc`:
```
Background of the scenario:
This scenario involves developing and testing financial factors using historical market data to predict future stock performance.
The source data you can use:

```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of QlibFactorScenario by setting up various attributes based on predefined dictionaries and functions.

parameters:
· None: This constructor does not accept any parameters directly.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when a new object of the class is created. In this context, it initializes an instance of QlibFactorScenario with several attributes that are crucial for setting up a factor experiment scenario using qlib, a quantitative finance library.

Upon initialization, the method first calls super().__init__(), which invokes the constructor of the parent class (if any). This ensures that any setup required by the superclass is performed before proceeding with the subclass-specific initializations.

The method then proceeds to initialize several private attributes of the QlibFactorScenario instance. These attributes are populated using data from a dictionary named `prompt_dict` and a function call to `get_data_folder_intro()`. The use of `deepcopy()` ensures that each attribute receives its own independent copy of the data, preventing any unintended side effects from modifications to these objects.

Here is a breakdown of what each attribute represents:
- `_background`: Contains background information related to qlib factor experiments.
- `_source_data`: Provides an introduction or description of the source data folder used in the experiment.
- `_output_format`: Specifies the format in which the output of the experiment should be presented.
- `_interface`: Describes the interface that will be used for interacting with the factor experiment.
- `_strategy`: Details the strategy that will be employed during the factor experiment.
- `_simulator`: Contains information about the simulator to be used for running the experiment.
- `_rich_style_description`: Offers a richly styled description of various aspects of the factor experiment, likely for better readability and presentation.
- `_experiment_setting`: Holds settings specific to the configuration of the factor experiment.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should ensure that `prompt_dict` is properly defined in their environment with all necessary keys (`qlib_factor_background`, `qlib_factor_output_format`, etc.) before creating an instance of QlibFactorScenario. Similarly, the function `get_data_folder_intro()` must be correctly implemented and return the expected data structure for `_source_data`. This setup allows for a flexible configuration of factor experiments within qlib by simply modifying these dictionaries and functions as needed.
