## ClassDef QlibFactorFromReportScenario
**QlibFactorFromReportScenario**: This class represents a specific scenario within the Qlib framework designed to generate factors from reports. It inherits from the `QlibFactorScenario` class, extending its functionality to cater specifically to scenarios where factors are derived from report data.

attributes:
· _rich_style_description: A private attribute that holds a richly formatted description of the scenario, likely used for display purposes in user interfaces or documentation. This attribute is initialized with a deep copy of a dictionary entry related to the scenario's description.

Code Description: The `QlibFactorFromReportScenario` class initializes by calling its superclass constructor through `super().__init__()`. It then sets up `_rich_style_description` using a deep copy of a predefined dictionary value, ensuring that any modifications to this attribute do not affect the original dictionary. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and avoiding unintended side effects.

The class includes a property method named `rich_style_description`, which provides read-only access to the `_rich_style_description` attribute. This design choice encapsulates the internal state of the object, allowing controlled access to its description without exposing the underlying implementation details directly.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to create and manage factor generation processes based on report data within the Qlib framework. The `QlibFactorFromReportScenario` class facilitates this by providing a structured way to define and describe such scenarios.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value when accessing the `rich_style_description` property could be:
"Qlib Factor From Report Scenario: This scenario is designed to generate trading factors based on data extracted from financial reports. It utilizes advanced parsing techniques to identify relevant information and convert it into usable factor formats for quantitative analysis within the Qlib framework."
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the QlibFactorFromReportScenario class.
parameters:
· None: This constructor does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that serves as the initializer for new objects. When a new object of the QlibFactorFromReportScenario class is created, this method is automatically called to set up the initial state of the object. Inside the method, it first calls super().__init__(), which invokes the constructor of the parent class (assuming there is one), ensuring that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed. Following this, it initializes an instance variable named _rich_style_description by making a deep copy of the value associated with the key "qlib_factor_from_report_rich_style_description" from the prompt_dict dictionary. Using deepcopy ensures that the new object has its own separate copy of the data structure stored in prompt_dict, preventing any unintended side effects if the original data is modified elsewhere.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of QlibFactorFromReportScenario to utilize its functionalities, which will automatically initialize the _rich_style_description attribute with a deep copy of the specified dictionary value. This setup is crucial for scenarios where maintaining independent copies of complex data structures is necessary to avoid unintended modifications affecting other parts of the application.

### FunctionDef rich_style_description(self)
**rich_style_description**: This function returns a string containing a rich style description, likely formatted for display purposes such as in a user interface or report.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The function `rich_style_description` is designed to provide a detailed and stylistically enhanced textual description. It retrieves this description from an internal attribute `_rich_style_description`. This attribute presumably holds the formatted string that includes rich text elements, which could be HTML tags, markdown formatting, or other styling instructions depending on the context in which it is used.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where a detailed and visually appealing description of an object or concept is required. For instance, this function might be part of a larger system for generating reports or dashboards that require rich text descriptions to enhance readability and user engagement.

Output Example: "The <b>QlibFactorFromReportScenario</b> class provides a framework for creating experiments based on factor analysis from financial reports, offering a <i>rich style description</i> to facilitate better understanding and presentation of the experimental setup."
