## ClassDef QlibModelExperiment
**QlibModelExperiment**: This class represents an experiment setup specifically designed for model tasks using Qlib, a financial market prediction library. It inherits from `ModelExperiment` and is tailored to work with `QlibFBWorkspace` and `ModelFBWorkspace`. The primary purpose of this class is to facilitate the creation and management of experiments within the Qlib framework.

**attributes**:
· *args: Variable length argument list passed to the superclass constructor, typically used for positional arguments.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments passed to the superclass constructor, allowing for flexible configuration options.

**Code Description**: The `QlibModelExperiment` class initializes by calling its parent class's initializer with all provided arguments. It then sets up an experiment workspace using `QlibFBWorkspace`. This workspace is initialized with a template folder path that points to a directory named "model_template" located in the same directory as the current file. The purpose of this setup is to provide a structured environment for conducting experiments, leveraging pre-defined templates and configurations.

**Note**: Usage points include initializing an instance of `QlibModelExperiment` by providing necessary arguments through *args and **kwargs. Developers can extend or customize this class further based on specific requirements of their model experiments within the Qlib framework. Beginners should ensure they have a basic understanding of Qlib's architecture and the role of workspaces in experiment management before using this class effectively.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the QlibModelExperiment class, setting up the experiment workspace using a specified template folder.

parameters:
· *args: Variable length argument list that is passed to the superclass constructor.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments that are also passed to the superclass constructor.

Code Description: The __init__ method begins by invoking the constructor of its superclass with all positional and keyword arguments it received. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed. Following this, an instance variable named experiment_workspace is created. It is initialized as an instance of QlibFBWorkspace, which is configured to use a template folder located at the path constructed by joining the directory containing the current file with "model_template". The Path object from the pathlib module is used to handle the construction and manipulation of this file system path.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the superclass has an appropriate constructor capable of handling *args and **kwargs. Additionally, developers should verify that the template folder exists at the specified location relative to the current file to avoid runtime errors related to file not found issues. This initialization step is crucial for setting up the environment necessary for model experiments within the Qlib framework.

## ClassDef QlibModelScenario
**QlibModelScenario**: This class represents a specific scenario within the Qlib framework focused on model experiments. It inherits from a base `Scenario` class and initializes several attributes that define the background, output format, interface, simulator, rich style description, and experiment settings for the model experiment.

attributes:
· _background: A string containing the background information of the scenario.
· _output_format: A string describing the expected output format of the code generated in this scenario.
· _interface: A string detailing the interface that should be followed to write runnable code.
· _simulator: A string providing details about a simulator that can be used to test the model.
· _rich_style_description: A string offering a rich description of the style expected for the scenario.
· _experiment_setting: A string containing settings specific to conducting experiments in this scenario.

Code Description: The `QlibModelScenario` class initializes its attributes by deep copying corresponding values from a dictionary named `prompt_dict`. This ensures that each instance of `QlibModelScenario` has its own copy of these strings, preventing unintended side effects if the original dictionary is modified elsewhere. The class provides several properties to access these attributes: `background`, `output_format`, `interface`, `simulator`, and `rich_style_description`. Each property returns the corresponding attribute value.

The `source_data` property raises a `NotImplementedError`, indicating that this functionality is not yet implemented in the current version of the class. This suggests that subclasses or future implementations should provide an appropriate implementation for retrieving source data specific to the scenario.

The `get_scenario_all_desc` method constructs and returns a comprehensive description of the scenario, combining background information, interface details, output format specifications, and simulator information into a single string. This method can be used to generate detailed documentation or instructions for users working within this scenario.

Note: Developers should ensure that any subclass of `QlibModelScenario` implements the `source_data` property if source data is required for their specific use case. Additionally, while the `rich_style_description` and `experiment_setting` properties are available, they are not included in the output of `get_scenario_all_desc`. If these details are important, developers may need to modify this method or create a custom version that includes them.

Output Example: When calling `get_scenario_all_desc`, the returned string might look like this:

Background of the scenario:
This scenario focuses on developing and testing financial prediction models using Qlib.
The interface you should follow to write the runnable code:
Your code must define a function named 'predict' that takes historical data as input and returns predictions for future prices.
The output of your code should be in the format:
A pandas DataFrame with two columns: 'datetime' and 'predicted_price'.
The simulator user can use to test your model:
Use the Qlib backtest framework to simulate trading strategies based on your model's predictions.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the QlibModelScenario class by setting up various attributes based on predefined configurations from a dictionary named `prompt_dict`.

parameters:
· None: The __init__ method does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __init__ function is the constructor for the QlibModelScenario class. It begins by calling the superclass's initializer using `super().__init__()`, ensuring that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed. Following this, it initializes several instance variables by deep copying corresponding values from a dictionary named `prompt_dict`. This dictionary appears to contain configuration settings or templates for different aspects of a Qlib model experiment scenario.

The attributes being initialized are:
- `_background`: Likely contains background information about the model or experiment.
- `_output_format`: Specifies how the output of the model should be formatted.
- `_interface`: Defines the interface through which the model interacts with other components.
- `_simulator`: Holds configuration details for a simulator used in the experiment.
- `_rich_style_description`: Provides a detailed, richly styled description of the model or scenario.
- `_experiment_setting`: Contains settings specific to conducting the experiment.

Using `deepcopy` from the `copy` module ensures that each instance of QlibModelScenario gets its own separate copy of these configurations. This is important for preventing unintended side effects if one instance modifies its configuration, as changes would not affect other instances sharing the same initial data.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should ensure that the `prompt_dict` dictionary is properly defined and contains all necessary keys (`qlib_model_background`, `qlib_model_output_format`, etc.) before instantiating QlibModelScenario. Beginners are advised to familiarize themselves with the structure of `prompt_dict` and the purpose of each configuration setting to effectively utilize this class in their experiments.

***
### FunctionDef rich_style_description(self)
**rich_style_description**: This function returns a string representation of a rich style description associated with an instance of QlibModelScenario. The rich style description is intended to provide detailed, formatted information about the model scenario.

parameters:
· None: This function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The function `rich_style_description` is defined within the class `QlibModelScenario`. It is a simple getter method that returns the value of an internal attribute `_rich_style_description`. This attribute presumably holds a string that contains a detailed and formatted description of the model scenario, possibly including various attributes or configurations related to the scenario.

***
### FunctionDef experiment_setting(self)
**experiment_setting**: This function retrieves a string representation of the experiment setting associated with an instance of QlibModelScenario.

parameters:
· No parameters: The function does not accept any input parameters.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `experiment_setting` method is defined within the context of a class, likely named `QlibModelScenario`. This method serves as a simple accessor to return a private attribute `_experiment_setting`, which holds a string value representing the configuration or settings for an experiment. The use of a leading underscore in the attribute name (`_experiment_setting`) suggests that it is intended to be treated as a non-public part of the class's interface, meaning it should not be accessed directly from outside the class.

The method itself does not perform any operations other than returning the value stored in `_experiment_setting`. This design pattern is common in object-oriented programming for encapsulating data and providing controlled access through getter methods. By using such a method, developers can retrieve the experiment settings without needing to know how or where they are stored within the class.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should use this function when they need to obtain the current experiment setting of an instance of `QlibModelScenario`. This could be useful for logging purposes, debugging, or any other scenario where understanding the configuration of a particular experiment is necessary. Since the method does not modify the state of the object, it can be called multiple times without affecting the behavior of the program.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
"{'model': 'LSTM', 'optimizer': 'Adam', 'learning_rate': 0.001, 'epochs': 50}"
This example output is a string representation of a dictionary containing various parameters that might define an experiment setting for a machine learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as the architecture, Adam optimizer, and specific values for learning rate and number of epochs. The actual content will depend on how `_experiment_setting` is initialized or modified within instances of `QlibModelScenario`.
