## FunctionDef process_results(current_result, sota_result)
**process_results**: This function processes two sets of results, converting them into a combined DataFrame focused on important metrics for comparison. It identifies which result is better for each metric without considering whether larger values are inherently better or worse.

parameters:
· current_result: A dictionary containing the current experiment's results.
· sota_result: A dictionary containing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) experiment's results.

Code Description: The function begins by converting the input dictionaries into pandas DataFrames. It sets the metric names as the index for both DataFrames and renames the default column to reflect whether it represents the current result or the SOTA result. These two DataFrames are then concatenated side-by-side based on their shared metric indices.

Next, a list of important metrics is defined, which includes specific performance indicators such as maximum drawdown, information ratio, annualized return, and IC (Information Coefficient). The combined DataFrame is filtered to include only these important metrics.

The function adds an additional column to the filtered DataFrame that indicates whether the current result or the SOTA result is higher for each metric. This comparison does not consider the direction of improvement for each metric; it simply identifies which value is numerically larger.

Finally, the function returns a string representation of this filtered and annotated DataFrame, providing a clear comparison between the current results and the SOTA results for the specified important metrics.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where one needs to compare two sets of experimental results based on predefined key performance indicators. The function is particularly useful in research or development settings where evaluating improvements against existing benchmarks is crucial.

Output Example:
```
metric                                     Current Result  SOTA Result  Bigger columns name (Didn't consider the direction of the metric, you should judge it by yourself that bigger is better or smaller is better)
1day.excess_return_without_cost.max_drawdown           -0.25          -0.30                                            SOTA Result
1day.excess_return_without_cost.information_ratio        0.85           0.75                                         Current Result
1day.excess_return_without_cost.annualized_return       15.00          14.50                                         Current Result
IC                                             0.60           0.55                                         Current Result

## ClassDef QlibFactorHypothesisExperiment2Feedback
**QlibFactorHypothesisExperiment2Feedback**: This class extends HypothesisExperiment2Feedback and is designed to generate feedback for a given experiment and hypothesis, specifically tailored for factor-based experiments within the Qlib framework.

attributes:
· exp (QlibFactorExperiment): The experiment object that contains the results of the tasks executed under this scenario.
· hypothesis (QlibFactorHypothesis): The hypothesis being tested in the experiment. This includes the textual description or implementation details of the hypothesis.
· trace (Trace): An object that records the sequence of actions and decisions made during the execution of the experiment.

Code Description: The generate_feedback method is responsible for creating detailed feedback based on the provided experiment, hypothesis, and trace. It starts by logging an informational message indicating that feedback generation has commenced. It then extracts the textual representation of the hypothesis and the results from both the current experiment and a baseline (state-of-the-art) experiment.

The method processes these results to highlight important metrics through a function called process_results. This processed data, along with details about each task in the experiment, is used to construct system and user prompts for an API call. These prompts are designed to guide an external AI model in generating feedback on the hypothesis based on the experimental outcomes.

The APIBackend class is utilized to send these prompts to a chat completion service, which returns a JSON response containing observations, evaluations of the hypothesis, potential new hypotheses, reasoning behind the evaluation, and a decision on whether the current result should replace the best-known result. This JSON response is parsed, and specific fields are extracted to form an instance of HypothesisFeedback.

Note: The method assumes that certain external components such as APIBackend, feedback_prompts, and convert2bool are properly defined elsewhere in the codebase. Developers must ensure these dependencies are correctly implemented for this class to function as intended.

Output Example: A possible return value from generate_feedback could be an instance of HypothesisFeedback with the following attributes:
observations: "The model performed well on high-frequency data but struggled with low-frequency predictions."
hypothesis_evaluation: "The hypothesis that increasing the number of training epochs would improve performance is partially supported by the results."
new_hypothesis: "Consider implementing a learning rate scheduler to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training."
reason: "While more epochs did lead to better accuracy on high-frequency data, they did not significantly impact low-frequency predictions. A learning rate scheduler might help in optimizing both aspects of the model's performance."
decision: True (indicating that this result should replace the best-known result if it meets other criteria)
### FunctionDef generate_feedback(self, exp, hypothesis, trace)
**generate_feedback**: This function generates feedback for a given experiment and hypothesis by comparing the current results against state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, using predefined prompts to guide an API call that provides detailed analysis.

parameters:
· exp: The experiment object of type QlibFactorExperiment for which feedback is being generated.
· hypothesis: The hypothesis object of type QlibFactorHypothesis related to the experiment.
· trace: A Trace object containing details about the execution of the experiment, though it is not directly used in this function.

Code Description: The function starts by logging that feedback generation has begun. It extracts the hypothesis text and results from the provided experiment and SOTA experiment objects. For each sub-task within the experiment, it gathers task information and implementation results. 

The current result and SOTA result are then processed using the `process_results` function to create a combined DataFrame focused on important metrics for comparison. This DataFrame highlights which result is numerically higher for each metric without considering whether larger values indicate better performance.

Next, system and user prompts are generated using Jinja2 templating. The system prompt sets the context for the feedback generation process based on the scenario description, while the user prompt includes details about the hypothesis, task results, and processed combined results.

The function then calls `APIBackend` to generate a chat completion response based on these prompts. This response is expected to be in JSON format, which is parsed to extract specific fields: observations, hypothesis evaluation, new hypothesis, reasoning, and a decision on whether to replace the best result with the current one.

Finally, the extracted information is used to create and return an instance of `HypothesisFeedback`, encapsulating all relevant feedback details.

Note: This function is particularly useful in research or development settings where evaluating improvements against existing benchmarks is crucial. It automates the process of generating detailed feedback by leveraging API-driven analysis based on structured prompts.

Output Example:
```
HypothesisFeedback(
    observations="The current hypothesis shows improved performance in annualized return and IC compared to the SOTA.",
    hypothesis_evaluation="The hypothesis is partially supported as it improves some key metrics but not others.",
    new_hypothesis="Consider refining the factor to further enhance information ratio without affecting other metrics negatively.",
    reason="While the annualized return and IC have improved, the max drawdown has also increased, indicating higher risk.",
    decision=True
)
```

## ClassDef QlibModelHypothesisExperiment2Feedback
**QlibModelHypothesisExperiment2Feedback**: This class generates feedback on a hypothesis based on executed implementations of different tasks, comparing them with previous performances. It inherits from `HypothesisExperiment2Feedback` and utilizes an API backend to generate detailed feedback.

attributes:
· exp: An instance of the Experiment class representing the current experiment.
· hypothesis: An instance of the Hypothesis class representing the hypothesis being evaluated.
· trace: An instance of the Trace class containing information about previous experiments and hypotheses.

Code Description: The `generate_feedback` method constructs a system prompt and user prompt using predefined templates. It includes context from the trace, details of the most recent successful hypothesis (SOTA_hypothesis) and its associated experiment (SOTA_experiment), as well as the current hypothesis and experiment. These prompts are then used to generate feedback via an API call. The response is expected to be in JSON format, which is parsed to extract observations, hypothesis evaluation, new hypotheses, reasoning, and a decision. This information is encapsulated into a `HypothesisFeedback` object.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to evaluate the performance of different models or tasks against historical data and generate actionable insights for future experiments.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "observations": "The model showed improved accuracy by 5% compared to the previous version.",
    "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis that increasing the number of layers would improve performance was correct.",
    "new_hypothesis": "Exploring different activation functions might further enhance the model's performance.",
    "reasoning": "The increase in accuracy aligns with the hypothesis, suggesting that deeper models are beneficial for this task.",
    "decision": true
}
### FunctionDef generate_feedback(self, exp, hypothesis, trace)
**generate_feedback**: This function generates feedback on a given hypothesis based on an experiment's trace. It constructs prompts using predefined templates, interacts with an API to obtain feedback, and then parses this feedback into a structured format.

parameters:
· exp: An instance of the Experiment class representing the current experimental setup.
· hypothesis: An instance of the Hypothesis class that needs evaluation or feedback.
· trace: An instance of the Trace class containing historical data from previous experiments for comparison.

Code Description: The function starts by logging an informational message indicating that feedback generation is underway. It then sets up a system prompt and user prompt using predefined templates stored in `feedback_prompts`. The user prompt includes context about the current scenario, details of the best-performing hypothesis (SOTA_hypothesis) from past experiments, and information about the current hypothesis and experiment.

The function uses the Jinja2 templating engine to render the user prompt with relevant data. It then calls the `APIBackend` class's method `build_messages_and_create_chat_completion` to send these prompts to an API for processing. The response from the API is expected in JSON format, which includes observations, feedback on the hypothesis, a potential new hypothesis, reasoning behind the feedback, and a decision.

The JSON response is parsed, and its contents are used to instantiate a `HypothesisFeedback` object, which encapsulates all the feedback details. This object is then returned by the function.

Note: The function relies on predefined prompts stored in `feedback_prompts`, an API backend for generating responses, and assumes that the API's response will be structured as expected with keys like "Observations", "Feedback for Hypothesis", etc.

Output Example:
{
    "observations": "The model performed well on the validation set but underperformed on unseen test data.",
    "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis was partially correct, but it did not account for overfitting.",
    "new_hypothesis": "Introduce regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.",
    "reason": "Regularization can help in reducing the complexity of the model and improving its performance on unseen data.",
    "decision": true
}
