## ClassDef KGKnowledgeDocument
**KGKnowledgeDocument**: Class for handling Kaggle competition specific metadata.
attributes:
· content: The main text content of the document.
· label: A label associated with the document, such as "Experiment Feedback" or "Kaggle Experience".
· embedding: An optional parameter representing an embedding vector of the document's content.
· identity: An identifier for the document.
· competition_name: The name of the Kaggle competition related to the document.
· task_category: The type of task involved in the competition, such as classification or regression. This is a required field.
· field: The specific field of knowledge covered by the document, e.g., feature engineering or modeling.
· ranking: The ranking achieved in the competition, if applicable.
· score: The score or metric achieved in the competition, if applicable.
· entities: A list of entities related to the content for integration into a knowledge graph.
· relations: A list of relations between entities for use in a knowledge graph.

Code Description: The KGKnowledgeDocument class extends a base Document class and is designed specifically to handle metadata associated with Kaggle competitions. It includes attributes that capture essential details about the competition, such as its name, the type of task, and performance metrics like ranking and score. Additionally, it supports integration with a knowledge graph through entities and relations.

The constructor initializes these attributes, setting default values where appropriate. The `split_into_trunk` method divides the document's content into smaller chunks and generates embeddings for each chunk using an API backend. This is useful for processing large documents in manageable parts.

The `from_dict` method allows loading document data from a dictionary, facilitating easy initialization of KGKnowledgeDocument instances with structured data. The `__repr__` method provides a string representation of the object, which includes key attributes like ID, label, competition name, task category, field, ranking, and score.

Note: Usage points include creating instances to store metadata about Kaggle competitions, splitting content into smaller parts for processing, loading data from dictionaries, and obtaining a readable string representation of the document's key information.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value when calling `__repr__` on an instance:
KGKnowledgeMetaData(id=12345, label=Experiment Feedback, competition=Experiment Result, task_category=General Task, field=Research Feedback, ranking=None, score=0.85)
### FunctionDef __init__(self, content, label, embedding, identity, competition_name, task_category, field, ranking, score, entities, relations)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of KGKnowledgeDocument specifically designed to encapsulate metadata related to Kaggle competition posts.

parameters:
· content: A string representing the main textual content of the document.
· label: An optional string used for categorizing or tagging the document.
· embedding: An optional parameter that could represent a vectorized form of the content, often used in machine learning models.
· identity: An optional identifier for the document.
· competition_name: An optional string indicating the name of the Kaggle competition associated with the post.
· task_category: A required string specifying the type of task involved in the competition (e.g., classification, regression).
· field: An optional string detailing the specific area or field of knowledge addressed by the content (e.g., feature engineering, modeling).
· ranking: An optional parameter that can be a string or an integer representing the ranking achieved in the competition.
· score: An optional float indicating the score or metric achieved in the competition.
· entities: An optional list containing entities related to the content, intended for integration into a knowledge graph.
· relations: An optional list detailing relationships between entities, also aimed at knowledge graph integration.

Code Description: The __init__ method initializes an instance of KGKnowledgeDocument by first calling the constructor of its superclass with parameters such as content, label, embedding, and identity. It then assigns values to additional attributes specific to Kaggle competition metadata including competition_name, task_category, field, ranking, score, entities, and relations. If entities or relations are not provided during initialization, they default to empty lists.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of KGKnowledgeDocument by providing necessary parameters such as content and task_category while optionally specifying other attributes like competition_name, field, ranking, score, entities, and relations for a more detailed representation of the document's context within a Kaggle competition. This method is crucial for setting up structured data that can be used in knowledge management systems or machine learning pipelines related to Kaggle competitions.

### FunctionDef split_into_trunk(self, size, overlap)
**split_into_trunk**: This function splits the content of a document into smaller chunks (trunks) based on a specified size, optionally with an overlap between chunks. It then generates embeddings for each trunk using an API backend.

parameters:
· size: An integer that specifies the maximum number of characters in each chunk. The default value is 1000.
· overlap: An integer indicating the number of overlapping characters between consecutive chunks. Currently, this parameter is not utilized in the function but is included in the method signature for potential future use.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by defining a nested helper function, `split_string_into_chunks`, which takes a string and a chunk size as input. This helper function iterates over the string in steps of the specified chunk size, slicing the string into smaller parts (chunks) and appending each to a list. The resulting list of chunks is then returned.

The main function uses this helper function to split the `content` attribute of the current object (`self.content`) into trunks based on the provided `size`. These trunks are stored in the `trunks` attribute of the object.

Following the creation of the trunks, the function calls an API backend's `create_embedding` method, passing the list of trunks as input. This method generates embeddings for each trunk and returns them. The resulting list of embeddings is then assigned to the `trunks_embedding` attribute of the object.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically called on instances of a document class (such as `KGKnowledgeDocument`) before adding the document to a vector database or similar structure. It prepares the document's content for efficient storage and retrieval by breaking it into manageable pieces and generating embeddings that can be used for similarity searches.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
While the function itself does not return a value, it modifies the state of the object by setting its `trunks` and `trunks_embedding` attributes. Here is an example of what these attributes might look like after calling `split_into_trunk` on a document with content "This is a sample text for demonstration purposes." and using a size of 10:

- trunks: ['This is a ', 'sample text', ' for demonstra', 'tion purposes.']
- trunks_embedding: [embedding_vector_1, embedding_vector_2, embedding_vector_3, embedding_vector_4]

Each `embedding_vector` would be a list or array of numerical values representing the semantic meaning of its corresponding trunk.
#### FunctionDef split_string_into_chunks(string, chunk_size)
**split_string_into_chunks**: This function divides a given string into smaller substrings (chunks) of a specified size.

parameters:
· string: The input string that needs to be split into chunks.
· chunk_size: An integer representing the maximum length of each chunk.

Code Description: The function initializes an empty list named 'chunks' to store the resulting substrings. It then iterates over the input string in steps defined by the 'chunk_size'. During each iteration, it extracts a substring from the current index up to the sum of the current index and the 'chunk_size', effectively creating a chunk of text. This chunk is appended to the 'chunks' list. After all iterations are complete, the function returns the 'chunks' list containing all the substrings.

Note: If the length of the input string is not perfectly divisible by the 'chunk_size', the last chunk will contain the remaining characters that do not fill up a full chunk size.

Output Example: For an input string "abcdefghij" and a chunk_size of 3, the function would return ['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'j'].
***
***
### FunctionDef from_dict(self, data)
**from_dict**: Load Kaggle post data from a dictionary.
parameters:
· data: A dictionary containing the data to be loaded into the KGKnowledgeDocument object.

Code Description: The function `from_dict` is designed to populate an instance of the `KGKnowledgeDocument` class with data provided in a dictionary format. It first calls the `from_dict` method of its superclass, presumably to handle common attributes or initialization steps shared across different document types. Following this, it specifically extracts and assigns values from the input dictionary for several Kaggle-specific attributes: `competition_name`, `task_category`, `field`, `ranking`, `score`, `entities`, and `relations`. If a particular key is not present in the dictionary, default values are used (None for strings and an empty list for lists). The function returns the modified instance of itself (`self`), allowing for method chaining or further manipulation.

Note: This function is crucial for initializing `KGKnowledgeDocument` objects with data from external sources, such as JSON files or API responses. It ensures that all relevant Kaggle post information is correctly mapped to the object's attributes, facilitating subsequent operations like searching and refining experiences based on this data.

Output Example: Assuming a dictionary input like `{"competition_name": "Titanic", "task_category": "Classification", "field": "Machine Learning", "ranking": 10, "score": 0.95, "entities": ["feature engineering", "model tuning"], "relations": [["uses", "scikit-learn"]]}`
The function would return a `KGKnowledgeDocument` object with the following attributes set:
- competition_name: "Titanic"
- task_category: "Classification"
- field: "Machine Learning"
- ranking: 10
- score: 0.95
- entities: ["feature engineering", "model tuning"]
- relations: [["uses", "scikit-learn"]]
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: This function provides a string representation of an instance of the KGKnowledgeMetaData class, which is useful for debugging and logging purposes.
parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The __repr__ method does not take any additional parameters beyond the implicit self parameter that refers to the instance of the class.

Code Description: The __repr__ method constructs a detailed string that includes several attributes of the KGKnowledgeMetaData object. These attributes are id, label, competition_name, task_category, field, ranking, and score. Each attribute is formatted into a string with its name and value, making it easy to identify each piece of information about the object. The use of f-strings (formatted string literals) allows for an efficient and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals.

Note: This method is intended to be unambiguous and should ideally return a string that could be used to recreate the object. However, in this case, it serves more as a detailed representation rather than a constructor call due to the nature of the attributes involved.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value would look like this:
"KGKnowledgeMetaData(id=12345, label='Example Label', competition=KaggleCompetition(name='Competition Name'), task_category='Classification', field='Machine Learning', ranking=10, score=0.9876)"
***
## ClassDef KaggleExperienceBase
**KaggleExperienceBase**: Class for handling Kaggle competition experience posts and organizing them for reference.

attributes:
· vector_df_path: Path to the vector DataFrame for embedding management.
· kaggle_experience_path: Path to the Kaggle experience post data.

Code Description: The `KaggleExperienceBase` class extends from `PDVectorBase`, designed specifically to manage and organize Kaggle competition experiences. Upon initialization, it accepts optional paths for a vector DataFrame and Kaggle experience posts. If a path to Kaggle experience posts is provided, the class loads this data during initialization.

The `add` method allows adding documents or lists of documents to the vector base. Each document is split into trunks if necessary, and each trunk (or the whole document if not split) is added as a separate entry in the vector DataFrame with relevant metadata such as ID, label, content, competition name, task category, field, ranking, score, and embedding.

The `load_kaggle_experience` method loads Kaggle experience data from a specified file path. It supports JSON or text files and logs success or failure messages accordingly.

The `add_experience_to_vector_base` method processes either provided experiment feedback or pre-loaded Kaggle experience data to create embeddings for each entry and adds them to the vector base. If experiment feedback is given, it extracts relevant knowledge from this feedback and creates a document with this information.

The `search_experience` method searches for relevant Kaggle experience posts based on a query modified by a target context. It returns the most similar documents along with their similarity scores. If initial search results do not meet expectations, it refines these results using an LLM (Large Language Model).

The `refine_with_LLM` method constructs prompts to refine text based on a given target and uses an API backend to generate refined feedback from an LLM.

Finally, the `save` method saves the current state of the vector DataFrame to a specified file path in pickle format.

Note: Usage points include initializing with paths to data files, adding documents or experience data, searching for relevant experiences, refining search results, and saving the updated vector base.

Output Example: When calling `search_experience("classification", "best practices", topk_k=3)`, the method might return a list of three KGKnowledgeMetaData objects representing the most relevant Kaggle competition experiences related to classification tasks, along with their similarity scores. Each object contains metadata such as content, label, competition name, task category, field, ranking, score, and embedding.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, vector_df_path, kaggle_experience_path)
**__init__**: This function initializes an instance of the `KaggleExperienceBase` class, setting up paths and loading Kaggle experience data if a path is provided.

parameters:
· vector_df_path: A string or Path object representing the path to the vector DataFrame used for embedding management. This parameter is optional.
· kaggle_experience_path: A string or Path object indicating the location of the file containing Kaggle experience post data. This parameter is also optional.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `__init__` function serves as the constructor for the `KaggleExperienceBase` class, responsible for initializing its attributes and setting up necessary resources based on the provided parameters. The function begins by calling the constructor of the superclass using `super().__init__(vector_df_path)`, which likely initializes some foundational components related to vector management.

Following this, it assigns the value of `kaggle_experience_path` to an instance variable `self.kaggle_experience_path`. This step ensures that the path to the Kaggle experience data is stored within the class instance for later use. The function then initializes an empty list `self.kaggle_experience_data`, which will be used to store the actual data loaded from the file specified by `kaggle_experience_path`.

If a valid path is provided through `kaggle_experience_path`, the function proceeds to call another method within the class, `load_kaggle_experience(kaggle_experience_path)`. This method is responsible for reading and parsing the Kaggle experience post data from the file located at the given path. The `load_kaggle_experience` method handles opening the file, loading its contents into a Python object (typically a list or dictionary), and storing this data in `self.kaggle_experience_data`.

Note: Usage points.
This function is automatically called when an instance of `KaggleExperienceBase` is created. Developers can provide paths to both vector DataFrame and Kaggle experience post data during the instantiation of the class. If no path for the Kaggle experience data is provided, the `kaggle_experience_data` attribute will remain as an empty list. It's important that if a path is given, it points to a valid file containing JSON formatted data to ensure successful loading and parsing by the `load_kaggle_experience` method.
***
### FunctionDef add(self, document)
**add**: This function adds a document or a list of documents to the vector database by first splitting the document content into trunks if necessary, creating embeddings for each trunk, and then appending the processed data to the existing vector DataFrame.

parameters:
· document: A single instance or a list of instances of `KGDocument`. Each document contains attributes such as id, label, content, competition_name, task_category, field, ranking, score, and embedding. If the document's content is large, it will be split into smaller chunks (trunks).

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by invoking the `split_into_trunk` method on the provided document(s). This method splits the document's content into manageable pieces called trunks if the content exceeds a certain size. It also generates embeddings for each trunk using an API backend.

After splitting, the function constructs a list of dictionaries (`docs`). Each dictionary represents a document or a trunk of a document with its attributes such as id, label, content, competition_name, task_category, field, ranking, score, and embedding. If the document was split into multiple trunks, additional entries are added to `docs` for each trunk.

The function then concatenates this list of dictionaries into a DataFrame using pandas' `pd.concat`. This DataFrame is appended to the existing vector DataFrame (`self.vector_df`) that holds all processed documents. The `ignore_index=True` parameter ensures that the index in the resulting DataFrame is reset, maintaining a continuous sequence of indices.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used after creating an instance or instances of `KGDocument` and optionally splitting their content into trunks with embeddings. It is part of the process to store documents efficiently in a vector database for later retrieval based on similarity searches. The function supports both single document additions and batch processing of multiple documents, making it versatile for different use cases.
***
### FunctionDef load_kaggle_experience(self, kaggle_experience_path)
**load_kaggle_experience**: This function loads Kaggle experience posts from a specified JSON or text file into the `KaggleExperienceBase` class instance.

parameters:
· kaggle_experience_path: A string or Path object representing the path to the file containing Kaggle experience post data. The file should be in JSON format for successful loading.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function `load_kaggle_experience` is designed to read and parse a file located at the path provided by `kaggle_experience_path`. It attempts to open this file with UTF-8 encoding, which is a standard character encoding supporting all Unicode characters. The function uses Python's built-in `open()` function in a context manager (`with` statement) to ensure that the file is properly closed after its contents are read.

Inside the `try` block, the function reads the file and loads its content into the `self.kaggle_experience_data` attribute of the class instance using `json.load()`. This method parses the JSON formatted string from the file into a Python dictionary or list, depending on the structure of the JSON data. After successfully loading the data, it logs an informational message indicating that the Kaggle experience data has been loaded from the specified path.

If the file specified by `kaggle_experience_path` does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised. The function catches this exception and logs an error message indicating that the data was not found at the given path. In this case, it initializes `self.kaggle_experience_data` as an empty list to ensure that the attribute remains in a consistent state.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically called during the initialization of the `KaggleExperienceBase` class if a valid path to Kaggle experience data is provided. It can also be invoked manually at any point after the instance creation to load or reload the Kaggle experience data from a different file. Developers should ensure that the file specified by `kaggle_experience_path` contains valid JSON formatted data for successful loading and parsing.
***
### FunctionDef add_experience_to_vector_base(self, experiment_feedback)
**add_experience_to_vector_base**: This function processes Kaggle experience data or experiment feedback and adds relevant information to a vector base. It handles two primary scenarios: when experiment feedback is provided, it extracts knowledge from this feedback and adds it to the vector base; otherwise, it processes existing Kaggle experience data stored in the instance.

**parameters**:
· experiment_feedback (dict, optional): A dictionary containing experiment feedback. If provided, this feedback will be processed and added to the vector base. The dictionary should include keys such as "hypothesis_text", "tasks_factors", and "current_result" for optimal processing.

**Code Description**: The function first checks if `experiment_feedback` is provided. If it is, the function extracts relevant knowledge from the feedback using a hypothetical `extract_knowledge_from_feedback` function (not detailed in the provided code). It then creates an instance of `KGKnowledgeDocument`, populating its attributes with data from the experiment feedback. The document's content is set to the value associated with "hypothesis_text", and other fields like label, competition_name, task_category, field, ranking, and score are populated accordingly. After creating the document, it generates an embedding for the document's content using the `create_embedding` method of `KGKnowledgeDocument`. Finally, the function adds this document to the vector base by calling the `add` method on the instance.

If no experiment feedback is provided, the function processes Kaggle experience data stored in `self.kaggle_experience_data`, which is assumed to be a list of dictionaries containing experience data. For each experience in this list, the function logs its processing and creates an instance of `KGKnowledgeDocument`. The document's attributes are populated with values from the experience dictionary, such as content, label, competition_name, task_category, field, ranking, and score. Similar to the feedback scenario, it generates an embedding for the document's content and adds this document to the vector base using the `add` method.

**Note**: This function is typically used after initializing a `KaggleExperienceBase` instance with Kaggle experience data or when new experiment feedback needs to be integrated into the knowledge management system. It supports both scenarios of adding individual feedback and batch processing of stored experiences, making it versatile for different use cases in managing Kaggle-related knowledge.

**Output Example**: While the function does not return a specific value, its effect can be observed by checking the state of the vector base after execution. For instance, if an experiment feedback is added, the vector base will include a new document with attributes like id, label, content, competition_name, task_category, field, ranking, score, and embedding. Similarly, processing Kaggle experience data will add multiple documents to the vector base, each representing an individual experience entry.
***
### FunctionDef search_experience(self, target, query, topk_k, similarity_threshold)
**search_experience**: This function searches for Kaggle experience posts related to a specified query, initially filtered by a target context. It retrieves top-k similar results based on a similarity threshold and refines these results using a Language Learning Model (LLM) if necessary.

parameters:
· target: A string representing the target context to refine the search query.
· query: A string representing the search query to find relevant experience posts.
· topk_k: An optional integer specifying the number of top similar results to return (default is 5).
· similarity_threshold: An optional float setting the similarity threshold for filtering results (default is 0.1).

Code Description: The function starts by modifying the original query to include the target context, enhancing the specificity of the search. It then calls a superclass method `search` with the modified query and specified parameters (`topk_k` and `similarity_threshold`) to retrieve initial search results along with their similarities.

The retrieved results are processed in a loop where each result is converted into an instance of `KGKnowledgeDocument`. For each document, the function `refine_with_LLM` is invoked to refine the content based on the target context. If the LLM provides feedback or adjustments, this feedback replaces the original content of the document.

The function returns two lists: one containing the refined documents and another with their corresponding similarities.

Note: This function is useful for retrieving and refining Kaggle experience posts that are relevant to a specific context or query. It leverages both vector-based search capabilities and LLM-driven refinement to provide high-quality, contextually accurate results.

Output Example: Assuming the function is called with `target="image classification"`, `query="best practices"`, `topk_k=3`, and `similarity_threshold=0.2`, it might return:
- A list of refined documents such as:
  - KGKnowledgeMetaData(id=1, label='Best Practices', competition='Cats vs Dogs', task_category='Classification', field='Modeling', ranking=None, score=0.85)
  - KGKnowledgeMetaData(id=2, label='Experiment Feedback', competition='MNIST', task_category='Classification', field='Data Preprocessing', ranking=1, score=0.95)
  - KGKnowledgeMetaData(id=3, label='Research Paper', competition='ImageNet', task_category='Classification', field='Feature Engineering', ranking=None, score=0.78)
- A list of similarities such as: [0.25, 0.21, 0.19]
***
### FunctionDef refine_with_LLM(self, target, text)
**refine_with_LLM**: This function refines a given text based on a specified target using a Language Learning Model (LLM). It constructs a system prompt and a user prompt from predefined templates, sends these prompts to an API backend for chat completion, and returns the refined response.

parameters:
· target: A string representing the context or subject that the refinement should align with.
· text: The original text that needs to be refined according to the specified target.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by creating a `Prompts` object using a YAML file located in the same directory as the script. This object is used to fetch predefined system and user prompts for refining text with an LLM. The system prompt is rendered without any additional context, while the user prompt includes placeholders for the target and text parameters, which are filled using Jinja2 templating.

The `APIBackend` class is then instantiated, and its method `build_messages_and_create_chat_completion` is called with the constructed prompts. This method sends a request to an LLM API, providing both the system and user prompts, and receives a refined version of the original text as a response. The function finally returns this refined text.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used in scenarios where text needs to be adjusted or improved based on specific criteria or contexts. It can be particularly useful in applications involving content generation, summarization, or personalization, where user input or predefined targets need to influence the output.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If the function is called with `target="data analysis"` and `text="analyze sales data"`, it might return a refined response like "Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the sales data, focusing on trends, seasonal variations, and key performance indicators to provide actionable insights."
***
### FunctionDef save(self, vector_df_path)
**save**: This function saves a vector DataFrame to a specified file path using the pickle format.

parameters:
· vector_df_path: A string or Path object representing the location where the vector DataFrame should be saved.

Code Description: The save method is designed to serialize and store the vector DataFrame, which is an attribute of the class instance (self.vector_df), into a file at the location specified by vector_df_path. This is achieved using the `to_pickle` method provided by pandas, which converts the DataFrame into a pickle format suitable for storage and later retrieval. After saving the DataFrame, the function logs an informational message indicating that the operation was successful and specifying the path to the saved file.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the vector_df_path is valid and writable. The user should also be aware that using pickle can pose security risks if loading pickled data from untrusted sources, as it can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. Therefore, it's crucial to only unpickle data from trusted sources.
