## FunctionDef extract_knowledge_from_high_score_answers(content)
**extract_knowledge_from_high_score_answers**: This function processes a given string of content, typically from high-scoring answers on Kaggle, to extract structured knowledge using a predefined system prompt and user prompt. It leverages an API backend to generate a chat completion response which is then parsed into JSON format.

parameters:
· content: A string representing the text content from which knowledge needs to be extracted.

Code Description: The function begins by defining a system prompt and a user prompt using Jinja2 templating. These prompts are crafted based on predefined templates stored in `prompt_dict`. The system prompt sets the context for the AI model, while the user prompt includes the specific content that requires analysis. 

The function then calls `APIBackend().build_messages_and_create_chat_completion` with these prompts to generate a response from an API. This response is expected to be in JSON format but may not always be correctly formatted due to potential errors or inconsistencies in the AI's output.

A try-except block attempts to parse this response into a Python dictionary using `json.loads()`. If parsing fails, it catches the `JSONDecodeError` and returns an error message indicating that the response could not be parsed as JSON. This ensures that the function always returns a dictionary, even if the API's output is malformed.

Note: The function is designed to work seamlessly with other parts of the project, such as `process_all_case_files`, which reads multiple case files from a directory and applies this knowledge extraction function to each file's content before aggregating the results into a single JSON file.

Output Example: 
{
    "knowledge_points": [
        {
            "topic": "Data Cleaning",
            "description": "The process of identifying and correcting (or removing) errors and inconsistencies within data."
        },
        {
            "topic": "Feature Engineering",
            "description": "The process of using domain knowledge to create new features that improve the performance of a machine learning model."
        }
    ]
}
This example illustrates how the function might return structured knowledge points extracted from high-scoring Kaggle answers. However, if there is an error in parsing the JSON response, it would return:
{
    "error": "Failed to parse LLM's response as JSON"
}
## FunctionDef extract_knowledge_from_feedback(feedback_response)
**extract_knowledge_from_feedback**: This function processes a dictionary containing feedback from an LLM (Large Language Model) to extract and structure relevant knowledge points.

parameters:
· feedback_response: A dictionary that holds the feedback response generated by an LLM, which includes details about an experiment or task evaluation.

Code Description: The function begins by constructing system and user prompts using Jinja2 templating. It retrieves template strings from a predefined dictionary `prompt_dict` under keys specific to extracting knowledge from Kaggle-related feedback. The `StrictUndefined` setting ensures that any undefined variables in the templates will raise an error, preventing silent failures.

The system prompt is designed to guide the LLM on how to interpret and analyze the feedback effectively. The user prompt incorporates the actual feedback response into a format that the LLM can process according to the instructions provided by the system prompt.

Following the creation of these prompts, the function calls `APIBackend().build_messages_and_create_chat_completion`, passing in the constructed user and system prompts along with a flag indicating JSON mode. This method sends the prompts to an API backend (presumably interacting with the LLM) and receives a response.

The response from the LLM is expected to be in JSON format, which the function attempts to parse using `json.loads()`. If parsing fails due to a `JSONDecodeError`, it catches the exception and returns a dictionary containing an error message indicating that the LLM's response could not be parsed as JSON. Otherwise, it returns the successfully parsed JSON object.

Note: This function is designed to work within a system where feedback from an LLM is structured in a way that can be analyzed and knowledge extracted programmatically. It assumes the existence of a `prompt_dict` with specific templates and an `APIBackend` class capable of interacting with an LLM API.

Output Example: Depending on the content of the feedback response, the output could vary widely. Here's a possible example:

{
    "knowledge_points": [
        {"topic": "Data Cleaning", "description": "The dataset contained missing values that were not handled appropriately."},
        {"topic": "Model Selection", "description": "A more complex model might yield better results given the nature of the data."}
    ],
    "recommendations": ["Handle missing data before training.", "Experiment with different models."]
}

This example illustrates a structured response where specific knowledge points and recommendations are extracted from the feedback.
## FunctionDef process_all_case_files(directory_path)
**process_all_case_files**: This function processes all files with a .case extension within a specified directory by extracting knowledge from their content using the `extract_knowledge_from_high_score_answers` function. The extracted knowledge is then aggregated into a single JSON file named "kaggle_experience_results.json" located in the same directory.

**parameters**:
· directory_path: A string representing the path to the directory containing .case files that need processing.

**Code Description**: The function starts by defining the output file path, which is a JSON file named "kaggle_experience_results.json" within the specified directory. It initializes an empty list `json_output` to store the knowledge extracted from each case file.

The function then iterates over all .case files in the given directory using `Path(directory_path).rglob("*.case")`. For each file, it opens and reads its content. This content is passed to the `extract_knowledge_from_high_score_answers` function, which processes the text to extract structured knowledge points.

The extracted knowledge from each file is appended to the `json_output` list. After all files have been processed, the function writes the aggregated knowledge data stored in `json_output` to the output JSON file using `json.dump()`. The `ensure_ascii=False` parameter ensures that non-ASCII characters are correctly written to the file.

**Note**: This function is designed to work seamlessly with the `extract_knowledge_from_high_score_answers` function, which handles the extraction of knowledge points from the content of each case file. It assumes that all .case files in the specified directory contain text data suitable for processing by the knowledge extraction system. The output JSON file will contain an array of objects, where each object represents the structured knowledge extracted from a single case file. If there are any errors during the parsing of the API response within `extract_knowledge_from_high_score_answers`, these errors will be included in the final JSON output as error messages.
