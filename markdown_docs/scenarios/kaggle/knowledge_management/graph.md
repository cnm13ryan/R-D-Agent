## ClassDef KGKnowledgeGraph
**KGKnowledgeGraph**: This class extends UndirectedGraph to manage a knowledge graph specifically designed for Kaggle scenarios. It handles loading, analyzing, and adding documents to construct a graph of nodes representing various elements like competitions, hypotheses, experiments, code, and conclusions.

**attributes**:
· path: A string or Path object indicating the file path where the knowledge graph data is stored. If None, it initializes an empty graph.
· scenario: An instance of KGScenario that provides context for analyzing documents. Can be None if no specific scenario is provided.

**Code Description**: The class starts by initializing its parent UndirectedGraph with the given path. If a valid file path is provided and exists, it loads the existing knowledge graph from this file and updates the path to include a timestamp in the filename. Otherwise, it reads all ".case" files from a predefined domain knowledge path, analyzes each document to extract relevant knowledge, and constructs the initial graph.

The `add_document` method allows adding new documents to the existing graph by analyzing them similarly and updating the graph accordingly. It also saves the updated graph back to the file.

The `analyze_one_document` method is responsible for extracting knowledge from a single document. It uses a chat-based API session with a system prompt tailored to the given scenario (if any) and iteratively requests knowledge extraction until no new information is provided or a maximum number of attempts is reached.

The `load_from_documents` method processes multiple documents concurrently using multiprocessing, analyzes each one, and constructs nodes and edges for the graph based on the extracted knowledge. Nodes are embedded in batches before being added to the graph.

**Note**: The class assumes the existence of certain global settings like KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING and RD_AGENT_SETTINGS, as well as a dictionary PROMPT_DICT containing templates for chat prompts. It also relies on an APIBackend for creating chat sessions and completions.

**Output Example**: After initializing with a path to existing knowledge graph data or by analyzing documents, the KGKnowledgeGraph instance will contain nodes representing competitions, hypotheses, experiments, code snippets, and conclusions, interconnected based on their relationships as extracted from the documents. For example, if a document discusses an experiment in a specific Kaggle competition, there would be nodes for both the competition and the experiment, connected by an edge indicating their relationship.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, scenario)
**__init__**: Initializes a KGKnowledgeGraph object by either loading an existing knowledge graph from a specified path or creating a new one from domain knowledge files if no valid path is provided.

parameters:
· path: A string, Path object, or None indicating the file path to load an existing knowledge graph. If the path is not provided or does not exist, the constructor will create a new knowledge graph.
· scenario: An optional KGScenario object that provides context for building the knowledge graph when creating it from domain knowledge files.

Code Description: The constructor first calls the superclass's initializer with the given path. It then checks if the provided path exists and is valid. If so, it loads the existing knowledge graph from this path using the `load` method. After loading, it updates the path to include a timestamp followed by "_kaggle_kb.pkl" to ensure that subsequent saves do not overwrite the original file.

If the path is None or does not point to an existing file, the constructor proceeds to create a new knowledge graph. It starts by initializing an empty list of documents. It then prints the domain knowledge path specified in `KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING.domain_knowledge_path` and iterates over all files with the ".case" extension within this directory. Each file is opened and its content is read into the documents list.

With the collected documents, the constructor calls `load_from_documents`, passing the list of document contents and the optional scenario object. This function processes each document to extract knowledge and constructs a knowledge graph by creating nodes and edges based on the extracted information. After constructing the new knowledge graph, it saves the graph using the `dump` method.

Note: The constructor is designed to handle both loading an existing knowledge graph from a file or initializing a new one from domain knowledge files when no valid path is provided. This flexibility allows for easy integration and usage in different scenarios where either pre-existing data or new data needs to be processed into a knowledge graph.

### FunctionDef add_document(self, document_content, scenario)
**add_document**: This function integrates a new document into an existing knowledge graph by processing its content and optionally using scenario-specific instructions to guide the extraction of relevant information.

**parameters**:
· document_content: A string representing the textual content of the document to be added to the knowledge graph.
· scenario: An optional KGScenario object that provides context or specific instructions for how the knowledge should be extracted from the document. If provided, it influences the analysis process.

**Code Description**: The function begins by invoking `load_from_documents`, passing a list containing the single document content and the scenario (if any). This step processes the document to extract structured knowledge, which is then used to construct nodes and edges for the knowledge graph. Nodes are created for different types of actions (hypothesis, experiments, code, conclusion) found in the document, and edges link these action nodes to a competition node that represents either a specific competition or general knowledge if no competition is specified.

The extracted knowledge is embedded using `batch_embedding` to prepare it for graph operations. Finally, each node pair (action node and its associated competition node) is added to the knowledge graph through `add_node`. After processing the document, the function calls `dump`, which presumably saves or updates the current state of the knowledge graph.

**Note**: This function is typically used when new documents need to be incorporated into an existing knowledge graph. It leverages parallel processing to efficiently handle the analysis and integration of document content, making it suitable for scenarios involving large datasets or complex documents. Developers should ensure that the `document_content` parameter contains valid text data and that the `scenario` object (if provided) is correctly configured to guide the extraction process as intended. Beginners are advised to familiarize themselves with the `load_from_documents` function and its components, such as `multiprocessing_wrapper`, `analyze_one_document`, and `batch_embedding`, to understand how document content is processed and integrated into the knowledge graph.

### FunctionDef analyze_one_document(self, document_content, scenario)
**analyze_one_document**: This function processes a single document to extract knowledge graph information based on a given scenario. It interacts with an API backend to generate structured knowledge from the text content of the document.

**parameters**:
· document_content: A string representing the textual content of the document to be analyzed.
· scenario: An optional KGScenario object that provides context or specific instructions for the analysis process.

**Code Description**: The function begins by constructing a system prompt using a template from `PROMPT_DICT`, incorporating details from the provided scenario if it is not None. This system prompt sets up the parameters and expectations for the knowledge extraction task. A chat session is then initialized with this system prompt using an API backend.

Next, a user prompt is created based on another template in `PROMPT_DICT`, which includes the document content to be analyzed. The function enters a loop where it sends the user prompt to the chat session and requests a JSON response containing extracted knowledge. This process is repeated up to 10 times, with each iteration refining or expanding upon the previously extracted knowledge by instructing the system to continue from the last step without repeating information.

The responses are parsed from JSON format and appended to a list called `knowledge_list`. After all iterations, this list of extracted knowledge items is returned.

**Note**: The function assumes that the API backend and prompt templates (`PROMPT_DICT`) are properly configured and available. It also relies on the `KGScenario` class to provide scenario-specific details if needed.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from `analyze_one_document` could be a list of dictionaries, each representing a piece of knowledge extracted from the document:

[
    {"competition": "Kaggle Competition 2023", "hypothesis": {"type": "Predictive Model", "details": "Model will predict stock prices based on historical data"}, "experiments": "Trained model with LSTM architecture", "code": "import tensorflow as tf\nmodel = tf.keras.Sequential([...])", "conclusion": "Model achieved 90% accuracy in validation set"},
    {"competition": "Kaggle Competition 2023", "hypothesis": {"type": "Feature Engineering", "details": "Use sentiment analysis on news articles"}, "experiments": "Applied VADER sentiment analysis to news data", "code": "from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\nanalyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()", "conclusion": "Improved model performance by 5%"}
]
***
### FunctionDef load_from_documents(self, documents, scenario)
**load_from_documents**: This function processes a list of document contents to build a knowledge graph by extracting relevant information from each document based on an optional scenario context.

**parameters**:
· documents: A list of strings, where each string represents the textual content of a document to be analyzed.
· scenario: An optional KGScenario object that provides context or specific instructions for the analysis process. If provided, it guides how the knowledge should be extracted from the documents.

**Code Description**: The function starts by utilizing `multiprocessing_wrapper` to parallelize the processing of each document in the list. For each document, it calls `analyze_one_document`, passing the document content and scenario (if any). This step extracts structured knowledge from the documents using an API backend.

The extracted knowledge is then processed to construct nodes and edges for a knowledge graph. Each piece of knowledge is associated with a competition node, which represents either a specific competition or general knowledge if no competition is specified. For each document, multiple types of actions (hypothesis, experiments, code, conclusion) are considered. Nodes are created for these actions, and edges are formed between the action nodes and their corresponding competition nodes.

The function then embeds all nodes using `batch_embedding` to prepare them for graph operations. Finally, it adds each node pair (action node and its associated competition node) to the knowledge graph using `add_node`.

**Note**: The function relies on the availability of the `analyze_one_document`, `multiprocessing_wrapper`, `UndirectedNode`, `tqdm`, `batch_embedding`, and `add_node` functions. It is designed to handle multiple documents efficiently by leveraging parallel processing, which can significantly speed up the knowledge extraction process for large datasets. This function is typically called during the initialization of a KGKnowledgeGraph object when no existing graph data is found or when new documents need to be added to an existing graph.
