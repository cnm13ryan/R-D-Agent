## FunctionDef ens_and_decision(test_pred_l, val_pred_l, val_label)
**ens_and_decision**: This function handles ensemble predictions from multiple models by averaging their outputs and then makes a final binary decision based on these averaged predictions.

parameters:
· test_pred_l: A list of numpy arrays, where each array contains predictions made by a different model on the test dataset.
· val_pred_l: A list of numpy arrays, where each array contains predictions made by a different model on the validation dataset.
· val_label: A numpy array containing the true labels for the validation dataset.

Code Description: The function begins by calculating the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) score for each set of validation predictions. These scores are used to determine the weight of each model's prediction in the ensemble, with higher-scoring models having greater influence. The weights are normalized so that they sum up to one.

Next, it computes a weighted average of the test predictions using these weights. This step ensures that more accurate models contribute more significantly to the final prediction. Similarly, a weighted average is computed for the validation predictions to evaluate the performance of the ensemble.

The function then calculates the AUROC score for the ensemble's validation predictions and stores all individual model scores along with the ensemble score in a pandas DataFrame. This DataFrame is saved as "scores.csv" for record-keeping and analysis purposes.

Finally, the function converts the weighted average test predictions into binary form by applying a threshold of 0.5. If a prediction value is less than 0.5, it is classified as 0; otherwise, it is classified as 1. The resulting binary predictions are returned as a numpy array.

Note: This function assumes that all input predictions are in the same format and scale, typically probabilities or scores ranging from 0 to 1. It also assumes that the validation labels are binary (0 or 1).

Output Example: If the weighted average test predictions were [0.23, 0.78, 0.45, 0.91], the function would return np.array([0, 1, 0, 1]) after applying the threshold of 0.5.
