## FunctionDef feat_eng(X, y, X_fit, y_fit, param)
**feat_eng**: This function performs feature engineering on input data, which may involve transforming the data based on certain parameters. It is designed to handle both fitting of transformation parameters and application of these parameters to transform new data.

parameters:
· X: np.ndarray - The input data array that needs to be transformed. For example, this could represent image data with shape (num_samples, height, width, channels) and dtype uint8.
· y: np.ndarray | None - The target data array associated with the input data X. This is optional and can be used for tasks like supervised learning where labels are available.
· X_fit: np.ndarray | None - Data used to fit the transformation parameters. If provided, it should have a similar structure to X.
· y_fit: np.ndarray | None - Target data corresponding to X_fit. Used in conjunction with X_fit when fitting transformation parameters.
· param: object | None - Pre-fitted parameters for the transformation. If provided, these parameters are used directly without refitting.

Code Description: The function is structured to handle both scenarios where transformation parameters need to be fitted and where pre-fitted parameters are available. In this example implementation, the function acts as an identity transform, meaning it does not alter the input data X or target y. However, the structure allows for more complex transformations by fitting parameters from X_fit and y_fit if param is None. The function returns the transformed data (which in this case remains unchanged), the transformed target (also unchanged), and the fitted parameters (which are simply passed through).

Note: This function demonstrates a typical workflow for feature engineering, including parameter fitting and application of transformations to both training and test datasets.

Output Example: Given an input array X with shape (100, 32, 32, 3) representing 100 RGB images of size 32x32 pixels, and a target array y with shape (100,) containing labels for these images, the function would return:
- transformed_data: np.ndarray with the same shape as X, unchanged.
- transformed_target: np.ndarray with the same shape as y, unchanged.
- fitted_param: object, which in this example is simply the input param or None if no fitting was performed.
