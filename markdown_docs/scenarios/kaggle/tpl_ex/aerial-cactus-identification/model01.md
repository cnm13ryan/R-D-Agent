## FunctionDef model_workflow(X, y, val_X, val_y, test_X)
**model_workflow**: Manages the workflow of a machine learning model, including training, validation, and testing. It handles data preprocessing, model creation, compilation, training, and prediction phases.

parameters:
· X: Training data features as a NumPy array.
· y: Training data labels as a NumPy array.
· val_X: Optional validation data features as a NumPy array.
· val_y: Optional validation data labels as a NumPy array.
· test_X: Optional test data features as a NumPy array.
· **hyper_params: Additional hyperparameters for the model, which include important parameters worth tuning.

Code Description: The function begins by assigning input variables to more descriptive names. It then sets up data augmentation using Keras' ImageDataGenerator class, crucial for improving model generalization, especially with small datasets. Hyperparameters such as batch size are retrieved from the `hyper_params` dictionary or default values are used if not provided.

The function proceeds to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Keras' Sequential API. The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and activation functions, max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, dense layers with dropout for regularization, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function suitable for binary classification.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, appropriate for binary classification tasks. Training callbacks include early stopping to prevent overfitting by monitoring validation loss and saving the best model based on validation performance.

Training occurs using the `fit` method, where the model learns from the training data while being validated against the validation set. After training, predictions are made on both the validation and test datasets using the trained model.

Note: The function assumes that the input data is preprocessed appropriately before being passed to it. It also expects labels in a format suitable for binary classification (e.g., 0s and 1s).

Output Example: The function returns a tuple containing predictions for the validation and test datasets. Each prediction array contains values between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the positive class.

Example:
```
(val_predictions, test_predictions) = model_workflow(X_train, y_train, val_X=val_val, val_y=y_val, test_X=X_test)
# val_predictions: array([0.987, 0.234, ...])
# test_predictions: array([0.567, 0.123, ...])
```
