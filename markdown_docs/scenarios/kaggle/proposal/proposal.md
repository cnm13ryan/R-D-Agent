## ClassDef KGHypothesis
**KGHypothesis**: This class extends the Hypothesis class to include an additional attribute `action`, representing a chosen action based on the hypothesis. It is designed to encapsulate detailed information about a hypothesis, including its reasoning, observations, and justifications, along with the specific action derived from it.

attributes:
· hypothesis: A string that describes the main hypothesis or assumption being considered.
· reason: A detailed explanation for why the hypothesis is proposed.
· concise_reason: A brief summary of the reason for the hypothesis.
· concise_observation: A succinct observation related to the hypothesis.
· concise_justification: A concise justification supporting the hypothesis.
· concise_knowledge: A brief statement summarizing relevant knowledge or data points.
· action: A string indicating the specific action that should be taken based on the hypothesis.

Code Description: The KGHypothesis class initializes with seven parameters, inheriting five from its parent Hypothesis class and adding one new attribute `action`. The constructor uses these parameters to set up an instance of KGHypothesis. The `__str__` method is overridden to provide a formatted string representation of the hypothesis, including all attributes for easy readability.

Note: This class is typically used in scenarios where hypotheses are generated and actions need to be derived from them, such as in automated data analysis or machine learning workflows. It is particularly useful when integrating with systems that require detailed documentation and justification of each step taken during an experiment or analysis process.

Output Example: When the `__str__` method is called on an instance of KGHypothesis, it returns a formatted string similar to the following:

Chosen Action: Perform feature engineering
Hypothesis: The dataset lacks sufficient features for accurate predictions.
Reason: Current features do not capture all relevant aspects of the data.
Concise Reason & Knowledge: Insufficient features; need more informative attributes.
Concise Observation: Model performance is below expected levels.
Concise Justification: Adding new features could improve model accuracy.
Concise Knowledge: Feature engineering enhances predictive models.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, hypothesis, reason, concise_reason, concise_observation, concise_justification, concise_knowledge, action)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the KGHypothesis class with detailed attributes related to a hypothesis and its supporting information.

parameters:
· hypothesis: A string representing the main hypothesis being proposed.
· reason: A string providing the rationale or reasoning behind the hypothesis.
· concise_reason: A brief summary of the reason, intended for quick reference.
· concise_observation: A succinct statement summarizing key observations relevant to the hypothesis.
· concise_justification: A short explanation justifying why the hypothesis is plausible or supported by evidence.
· concise_knowledge: A compact representation of pertinent knowledge that supports the hypothesis.
· action: A string indicating the recommended action based on the hypothesis and its supporting details.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor for the KGHypothesis class. It takes seven parameters, each contributing to a comprehensive description of a hypothesis and its context. The first six parameters are passed to the superclass's initializer using super().__init__(), suggesting that KGHypothesis inherits from another class (likely containing these attributes). The seventh parameter, 'action', is unique to this class and is stored as an instance variable. This setup allows for the creation of hypothesis objects with detailed information and a recommended course of action.

Note: When creating an instance of KGHypothesis, ensure that all parameters are provided as strings. The 'action' parameter should clearly outline what steps or decisions should be taken based on the hypothesis. This method is essential for initializing objects in scenarios where structured reasoning and decision-making processes are required, such as in data analysis or proposal writing contexts.
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: This method returns a string representation of an instance of the KGHypothesis class, detailing various attributes of the hypothesis in a formatted manner.
parameters:
· None: The __str__ method does not accept any parameters as it is designed to provide a string representation of the object itself based on its existing attributes.

Code Description: The function constructs and returns a multi-line string that includes several key pieces of information about the KGHypothesis instance. It uses an f-string to format these details, which are accessed through self.action, self.hypothesis, self.reason, self.concise_reason, self.concise_observation, self.concise_justification, and self.concise_knowledge attributes of the class. Each attribute is labeled appropriately in the output string for clarity.

Note: This method is particularly useful for debugging or logging purposes as it provides a clear and concise summary of the hypothesis object's state at any given time.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
Chosen Action: Predict
Hypothesis: The stock price will rise tomorrow.
Reason: Based on recent trends and market indicators, there is an upward momentum in the stock.
Concise Reason & Knowledge: Recent trends indicate an upward movement.
Concise Observation: Market indicators show positive signals.
Concise Justification: Positive signals from market indicators support the prediction.
Concise Knowledge: Stock prices often follow trends influenced by market indicators.

## FunctionDef generate_RAG_content(scen, trace, hypothesis_and_feedback, target, chosen_hypothesis, chosen_hypothesis_type)
**generate_RAG_content**: This function generates content using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach based on the scenario, trace, hypothesis, and feedback provided. It retrieves relevant experiences from either a vector-based or graph-based knowledge base to augment the generation process.

parameters:
· scen: An instance of KGScenario that contains information about the scenario, including whether to use vector RAG or graph RAG.
· trace: An instance of Trace that holds historical data and actions taken in the current session.
· hypothesis_and_feedback: A string containing the current hypothesis and any feedback received from previous experiments.
· target: An optional string specifying a target action or goal for which relevant experiences are sought. This is used when if_action_choosing_based_on_UCB is True in scen.
· chosen_hypothesis: An optional string representing a specific hypothesis to focus on, used for more targeted searches within the knowledge base.
· chosen_hypothesis_type: An optional string indicating the type of the chosen hypothesis, which helps in refining the search criteria.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if vector RAG is enabled in the scenario. If so, it performs a search in the vector base to retrieve relevant documents based on the target and hypothesis_and_feedback. The number of results retrieved depends on whether the scenario is marked as a mini_case (1 result) or not (5 results). These documents are then joined into a single string and returned.

If vector RAG is not enabled, the function checks if graph RAG is enabled and if a knowledge base is available in the trace. If both conditions are met, it proceeds to find nodes related to the current competition description. It retrieves hypothesis nodes connected to these competition nodes through actions specified in KG_ACTION_LIST. For each hypothesis node found, it gathers associated experiment and conclusion information.

If a specific hypothesis is provided (chosen_hypothesis), the function performs a semantic search for similar nodes and then looks for additional hypothesis nodes within three steps of these similar nodes, constrained by the chosen_hypothesis_type. It collects up to five such nodes, sorts them by content length, and gathers experiment and conclusion information for each.

If no specific hypothesis is provided, the function performs a semantic search using the competition description as the query node. For each similar node found, it searches for hypothesis nodes within three steps, constrained by action types in KG_ACTION_LIST. It collects up to two such nodes per action type, sorts them by content length, and gathers experiment and conclusion information for each.

The function then uses a Jinja2 template (prompt_dict["KG_hypothesis_gen_RAG"]) to render the insights and experiences gathered into a final string, which is returned as the RAG content.

Note: The function assumes that certain objects like scen, trace, and prompt_dict are properly initialized and contain necessary data for its operations. It also relies on methods such as search_experience, get_node_by_content, get_nodes_within_steps, and semantic_search to interact with the knowledge base.

Output Example: 
```
Hypothesis: Increasing the learning rate will improve model performance.
Experiments: Conducted experiments with learning rates 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3.
Conclusion: Model performance improved significantly with a learning rate of 0.2.

Insight 1:
Hypothesis: Reducing dropout rate enhances generalization.
Experiments: Experiment conducted with dropout rates 0.5 and 0.7.
Conclusion: Lower dropout rate led to better validation accuracy.

Insight 2:
Hypothesis: Using batch normalization improves training stability.
Experiments: Batch normalization was applied in the second layer.
Conclusion: Training became more stable, but no significant performance gain observed.
```
## ClassDef KGHypothesisGen
**KGHypothesisGen**: This class is designed to generate hypotheses based on a given scenario, typically within data mining contexts such as Kaggle competitions. It inherits from `FactorAndModelHypothesisGen` and is responsible for updating reward estimates, selecting the next action based on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, preparing context for hypothesis generation, and converting responses into structured hypothesis objects.

**attributes**:
· scen: An instance of the Scenario class that encapsulates all necessary information about the current scenario, including actions, rewards, performance metrics, and configurations.

**Code Description**: The `KGHypothesisGen` class includes several key methods. The constructor initializes the object with a given scenario. The `update_reward_estimates` method calculates and updates the reward estimates for each action based on the latest trace of interactions. It computes the difference in performance between consecutive actions to determine the reward, adjusting it by the number of times an action has been taken.

The `execute_next_action` method selects the next action to be executed. If there are untried actions, one of them is chosen randomly. Otherwise, it uses the UCB algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation, selecting the action with the highest Upper Confidence Bound value.

The `prepare_context` method constructs a context dictionary that includes hypothesis and feedback information, RAG content (which seems to be some form of generated response or summary), and specifications for generating hypotheses. This context is used in subsequent steps to generate detailed hypotheses.

Finally, the `convert_response` method takes a string response, typically from an external system like a language model, and converts it into a structured `KGHypothesis` object containing various components such as hypothesis text, reasons, observations, justifications, knowledge, and actions.

**Note**: The class is designed to be flexible and can potentially be shared across different data mining scenarios. It relies on the scenario configuration for its behavior, making it adaptable to various contexts without modification.

**Output Example**: A possible output from the `convert_response` method could look like this:

{
    "hypothesis": "Increasing the learning rate of the LightGBM model to 0.1 will improve performance.",
    "reason": "The current learning rate is too low, and increasing it can help the model converge faster and achieve better results.",
    "concise_reason": "Learning rate is too low.",
    "concise_observation": "Model converges slowly with current settings.",
    "concise_justification": "Increasing learning rate can improve convergence speed.",
    "concise_knowledge": "Higher learning rates often lead to faster convergence in gradient boosting models.",
    "action": "Increase LightGBM learning rate"
}
### FunctionDef __init__(self, scen)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the KGHypothesisGen class, taking a Scenario object as input and returning a tuple containing a dictionary and a boolean value.

parameters:
· scen: An instance of the Scenario class that provides the context or data necessary for hypothesis generation.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor in Python used to initialize newly created objects. In this case, it initializes an object of the KGHypothesisGen class using the provided Scenario object. The method calls the superclass's initializer with the same scenario object, which suggests that KGHypothesisGen likely inherits from another class. The return type annotation indicates that the constructor is expected to return a tuple consisting of a dictionary and a boolean value, although based on typical Python conventions for constructors, this might be an oversight or misunderstanding as constructors typically do not return values other than None in Python.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that a valid Scenario object is passed when creating an instance of KGHypothesisGen. Developers should also be aware of the expected structure and contents of the Scenario object to ensure proper functionality of the class methods that depend on this initialization. Additionally, the return type annotation might need clarification or adjustment based on the actual implementation details of the class's behavior.
***
### FunctionDef update_reward_estimates(self, trace)
**update_reward_estimates**: This function updates the reward estimates for actions based on the performance results from a given trace.

parameters:
· trace: An object of type Trace, which contains historical entries of actions and their corresponding results.

Code Description: The function starts by checking if there are any entries in the trace's history. If there are no entries (i.e., it is the first iteration), the function does nothing and returns immediately. Otherwise, it proceeds to extract the last action and its result from the trace. It then retrieves the performance metric for this action, denoted as `performance_t`.

The function also checks if there is a previous entry in the trace's history (i.e., more than one entry exists). If so, it extracts the performance metric from the second-to-last entry, referred to as `performance_t_minus_1`. If there is no previous entry, it uses an initial performance value stored in `self.scen.initial_performance`.

Next, the function calculates a reward based on the difference between the current and previous performance metrics. The calculation of the reward depends on whether the evaluation metric direction (improvement or deterioration) is positive or negative, as indicated by `self.scen.evaluation_metric_direction`. If the direction is positive, the reward is calculated as the increase in performance divided by the previous performance value; if negative, it calculates the decrease in performance. However, there seems to be an inconsistency in the code where the reward calculation is overwritten with a fixed formula `(performance_t - performance_t_minus_1) / performance_t_minus_1` regardless of the evaluation metric direction.

The function then updates the reward estimate for the last action using a running average method. It retrieves the current count and estimated reward for the action from `self.scen.action_counts` and `self.scen.reward_estimates`, respectively. The new reward estimate is computed by adjusting the previous estimate towards the newly calculated reward, weighted by the number of times the action has been taken.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the trace object passed to this function contains valid historical entries with actions and results. Developers should also be aware of the potential inconsistency in the reward calculation logic as noted above. It is advisable to review and correct the reward calculation if necessary, especially considering the evaluation metric direction.
***
### FunctionDef execute_next_action(self, trace)
**execute_next_action**: This function determines the next action to be executed based on a given trace of actions and their outcomes. It employs an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategy to balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring that less tried actions have a chance to be selected while also favoring actions with higher estimated rewards.

**parameters**:
· trace: An object containing historical data about the sequence of actions taken and their results. This is crucial for the function to make informed decisions on subsequent actions.

**Code Description**: The function starts by listing all possible actions from `self.scen.action_counts`, which holds a dictionary where keys are action names and values are counts of how many times each action has been executed. It calculates the total number of actions taken so far plus one (`t`), accounting for the upcoming action.

The function then checks if any action has not yet been tried (i.e., its count is zero). If such an action exists, it selects this action to promote exploration and returns it immediately.

If all actions have been tried at least once, the function proceeds to calculate the UCB value for each action. The UCB formula used here is `mu_o + c * sqrt(log(t) / n_o)`, where:
- `mu_o` is the estimated reward of the action (obtained from `self.scen.reward_estimates[action]`),
- `c` is a confidence parameter that controls the degree of exploration versus exploitation,
- `n_o` is the number of times the action has been taken so far.

The UCB values are stored in a dictionary, and the function selects the action with the highest UCB value to maximize the expected reward while balancing exploration. This selected action is then returned.

**Note**: The function assumes that `self.scen.action_counts`, `self.scen.reward_estimates`, and `self.scen.confidence_parameter` are properly initialized and updated elsewhere in the codebase. It also relies on the `math` module for mathematical operations, which should be imported before using this function.

**Output Example**: If the possible actions are 'tune_hyperparameters', 'add_feature', and 'remove_outliers', and assuming that 'tune_hyperparameters' has not been tried yet, the function would return 'tune_hyperparameters'. If all actions have been tried and their UCB values are as follows: {'tune_hyperparameters': 2.5, 'add_feature': 3.1, 'remove_outliers': 2.8}, then the function would return 'add_feature' since it has the highest UCB value.
***
### FunctionDef prepare_context(self, trace)
**prepare_context**: This function prepares a context dictionary used for generating hypotheses in a Kaggle competition scenario. It constructs detailed information based on historical data, current state, and specific conditions related to action selection strategies.

parameters:
· trace: An instance of Trace that holds historical data about the sequence of actions taken and their results. This is essential for building the context with relevant past experiences and feedback.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if there are any previous hypotheses and feedback available in the trace history. If so, it uses a Jinja2 template to render these details into a string; otherwise, it sets a default message indicating that no previous data is available because it's the first round.

Next, the function checks if action selection should be based on an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategy as defined in `self.scen.if_action_choosing_based_on_UCB`. If true, it calls `execute_next_action` to determine the next action to take and stores this action for later use.

The function then constructs a hypothesis specification string that guides users to create specific and actionable hypotheses. This string includes examples of good and bad hypotheses. If there is historical data available, it appends information about the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) features, models, and results from the last experiment in the trace history.

If UCB-based action selection is enabled, the function appends details about the next experiment action and its specification to the hypothesis specification string. This helps users understand what actions are being considered based on the UCB strategy.

Finally, the function constructs a context dictionary (`context_dict`) that includes:
- `hypothesis_and_feedback`: The rendered string of previous hypotheses and feedback or a default message.
- `RAG`: Content generated using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach by calling `generate_RAG_content`. This content provides relevant insights and experiences based on the scenario, trace, hypothesis, and feedback.
- `hypothesis_output_format`: A predefined format for outputting hypotheses as specified in `prompt_dict`.
- `hypothesis_specification`: The detailed specification string guiding users to create specific and actionable hypotheses.

The function returns this context dictionary along with a boolean value `True`, indicating successful preparation of the context.

Note: This function assumes that `self.scen` contains necessary attributes like `if_action_choosing_based_on_UCB`, `action_counts`, `reward_estimates`, and `confidence_parameter`. It also relies on the `prompt_dict` for template strings used in rendering hypotheses and RAG content. The `trace` parameter must be a valid Trace object containing historical action data.

Output Example: 
{
  'hypothesis_and_feedback': 'Previous Hypothesis: Tune learning rate\nFeedback: Model overfits',
  'RAG': 'Insight 1: Experiment with dropout layers\nHypothesis: Reduce dropout to 0.2\nConclusion: Improved generalization',
  'hypothesis_output_format': '{action}: {description}',
  'hypothesis_specification': 'Create specific and actionable hypotheses.\nGood example: Increase batch size to 64.\nBad example: Improve model.'
}
***
### FunctionDef convert_response(self, response)
**convert_response**: This function takes a JSON-formatted string as input, representing a hypothesis along with its supporting details and an action derived from it. It parses this string into a dictionary and then constructs an instance of the KGHypothesis class using the data extracted from the dictionary.

parameters:
· response: A string in JSON format that contains keys for 'hypothesis', 'reason', 'concise_reason', 'concise_observation', 'concise_justification', 'concise_knowledge', and 'action'. Each key maps to a corresponding value that describes different aspects of the hypothesis and the action derived from it.

Code Description: The function begins by converting the input string `response` into a dictionary using `json.loads()`. It then creates an instance of the KGHypothesis class, initializing it with values extracted from the dictionary. If any key is missing in the dictionary, default strings are provided to ensure that the KGHypothesis object is always constructed successfully. The function finally returns this newly created KGHypothesis object.

Note: This function is particularly useful when dealing with systems that generate hypotheses and actions based on data analysis or machine learning processes. It facilitates the conversion of raw JSON responses into structured objects, making it easier to handle and utilize the information in subsequent parts of an application.

Output Example: If the input string `response` is '{"hypothesis": "The dataset lacks sufficient features for accurate predictions.", "reason": "Current features do not capture all relevant aspects of the data.", "concise_reason": "Insufficient features", "concise_observation": "Model performance is below expected levels.", "concise_justification": "Adding new features could improve model accuracy.", "concise_knowledge": "Feature engineering enhances predictive models.", "action": "Perform feature engineering"}', the function will return a KGHypothesis object. When the `__str__` method of this object is called, it outputs:

Chosen Action: Perform feature engineering
Hypothesis: The dataset lacks sufficient features for accurate predictions.
Reason: Current features do not capture all relevant aspects of the data.
Concise Reason & Knowledge: Insufficient features
Concise Observation: Model performance is below expected levels.
Concise Justification: Adding new features could improve model accuracy.
Concise Knowledge: Feature engineering enhances predictive models.
***
## ClassDef KGHypothesis2Experiment
**KGHypothesis2Experiment**: This class extends `FactorAndModelHypothesis2Experiment` and is designed to handle experiments related to knowledge graph (KG) hypotheses, specifically for feature engineering, feature processing, model feature selection, and model tuning actions.

**attributes**:
· hypothesis: An instance of the Hypothesis class representing a proposed action or idea in the experiment.
· trace: An instance of the Trace class that contains historical data about previous experiments and interactions.

**Code Description**: The `KGHypothesis2Experiment` class includes methods to prepare context for an experiment, convert responses from feature engineering/processing actions into structured `KGFactorExperiment` objects, and convert responses from model feature selection/tuning actions into structured `KGModelExperiment` objects. 

The `prepare_context` method constructs a dictionary containing essential information such as the target hypothesis, scenario details, previous hypotheses and feedback, expected experiment output format, a list of models involved in past experiments, and a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) content summary. This context is used to guide subsequent steps in the experimentation process.

The `convert_feature_experiment` method takes a JSON string response from an action related to feature engineering or processing and parses it into a structured `KGFactorExperiment` object. It extracts details such as factor names, descriptions, formulations, and variables from the response and organizes them into tasks that are part of the experiment.

The `convert_model_experiment` method processes a JSON string response from actions involving model feature selection or tuning. It validates the provided model type against a predefined list (`KG_SELECT_MAPPING`) and constructs a `KGModelExperiment` object with details like model name, description, architecture, hyperparameters, and base code (if applicable).

The `convert_response` method determines whether to use `convert_feature_experiment` or `convert_model_experiment` based on the current action specified in the hypothesis. It ensures that responses are correctly parsed into their respective experiment types.

**Note**: This class is crucial for automating the conversion of textual responses from experimentation actions into structured data objects, which can be used for further processing and analysis within a knowledge graph-based system.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from `prepare_context` could look like this:
{
    "target_hypothesis": "Feature engineering to improve dataset quality",
    "scenario": "Scenario details related to hypothesis_and_experiment tag...",
    "hypothesis_and_feedback": "No previous hypothesis and feedback available since it's the first round.",
    "experiment_output_format": "Expected output format for feature experiments...",
    "target_list": ["Model1", "Model2"],
    "RAG": "Summary of relevant information based on the scenario, hypothesis, and feedback..."
}, True

A possible return value from `convert_feature_experiment` could be:
KGFactorExperiment(
    sub_tasks=[
        FactorTask(factor_name="Feature1", factor_description=("Description for Feature1",), 
                   factor_formulation=("Formulation for Feature1",), variables=("Variables for Feature1",), version=2),
        FactorTask(factor_name="Feature2", factor_description=("Description for Feature2",), 
                   factor_formulation=("Formulation for Feature2",), variables=("Variables for Feature2",), version=2)
    ],
    based_experiments=[
        KGFactorExperiment(sub_tasks=[], source_feature_size=100),
        # Additional experiments from trace.hist
    ]
)

A possible return value from `convert_model_experiment` could be:
KGModelExperiment(
    sub_tasks=[
        ModelTask(name="RandomForest", description="A random forest model for classification",
                  architecture="Ensemble of decision trees", hyperparameters={"n_estimators": 100},
                  model_type="random_forest", version=2, base_code=None)
    ],
    based_experiments=[
        KGModelExperiment(sub_tasks=[], source_feature_size=100),
        # Additional experiments from trace.hist
    ]
)
### FunctionDef prepare_context(self, hypothesis, trace)
**prepare_context**: This function prepares a context dictionary containing various pieces of information derived from a hypothesis and its associated trace. It is designed to gather relevant data for generating detailed reports or further processing in scenarios involving machine learning experiments.

parameters:
· hypothesis: An instance of KGHypothesis, which includes details about the hypothesis being considered, such as its description, reasoning, observations, justifications, and the specific action derived from it.
· trace: An instance of Trace that holds historical data and actions taken in the current session, including previous hypotheses and feedback.

Code Description: The function starts by retrieving a scenario description from the trace, filtered with the tag "hypothesis_and_experiment". It then asserts that the provided hypothesis is an instance of KGHypothesis. Depending on whether the action specified in the hypothesis involves feature engineering or processing, it selects an appropriate experiment output format from a predefined dictionary.

The function sets the current action based on the hypothesis's action attribute. It then constructs a string containing previous hypotheses and feedback if available; otherwise, it notes that no previous data is present since it is the first round.

Next, it compiles a list of experiments from the trace history. For each experiment, it extracts information about sub-tasks and gathers task details into a model list. This list includes various pieces of information relevant to the tasks performed during the experiments.

Finally, the function constructs and returns a dictionary containing:
- The target hypothesis as a string.
- The scenario description.
- The compiled string of previous hypotheses and feedback.
- The selected experiment output format.
- The model list with task details.
- RAG content generated using the generate_RAG_content function, which retrieves relevant insights based on the current hypothesis and feedback.

The function also returns a boolean value True, indicating successful execution.

Note: This function is crucial for preparing comprehensive context data that can be used in generating detailed reports or further processing steps in machine learning experiments. It ensures that all necessary information from previous hypotheses and experiments is included and formatted appropriately.

Output Example:
{
    "target_hypothesis": "Chosen Action: Perform feature engineering\nHypothesis: The dataset lacks sufficient features for accurate predictions.\nReason: Current features do not capture all relevant aspects of the data.\nConcise Reason & Knowledge: Insufficient features; need more informative attributes.\nConcise Observation: Model performance is below expected levels.\nConcise Justification: Adding new features could improve model accuracy.\nConcise Knowledge: Feature engineering enhances predictive models.",
    "scenario": "Scenario description related to hypothesis and experiment...",
    "hypothesis_and_feedback": "Previous hypothesis: The dataset needs more features. Feedback: Model performance improved with additional features.",
    "experiment_output_format": "Feature Engineering Output Format",
    "target_list": ["Task 1 details", "Task 2 details"],
    "RAG": "Hypothesis: Increasing the learning rate will improve model performance.\nExperiments: Conducted experiments with learning rates 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3.\nConclusion: Model performance improved significantly with a learning rate of 0.2."
}, True
***
### FunctionDef convert_feature_experiment(self, response, trace)
**convert_feature_experiment**: This function processes a JSON-formatted response string to extract feature-related information and constructs a KGFactorExperiment object based on this data. It is specifically designed to handle responses related to feature engineering or processing tasks.

parameters:
· response: A string containing JSON data that describes various factors, each with its own description, formulation, and variables.
· trace: An instance of the Trace class, which provides contextual information about the experiment's history and input shape.

Code Description: The function begins by parsing the 'response' string into a Python dictionary using json.loads(). It then iterates over each factor name in this dictionary. For each factor, it retrieves the description, formulation, and variables, providing default messages if any of these are not present in the response. These details are used to create an instance of FactorTask, which is appended to a list called 'tasks'. After processing all factors, the function constructs a KGFactorExperiment object. This object includes the list of tasks and references previous experiments based on information stored in the trace object.

Note: This function is typically invoked when handling responses related to feature engineering or processing actions within an experiment framework. It plays a crucial role in translating textual descriptions into structured experimental data that can be used for further analysis or model training.

Output Example: A possible return value of this function could look like:
{
    "sub_tasks": [
        {
            "factor_name": "feature1",
            "factor_description": ("Description of feature 1",),
            "factor_formulation": ("Formulation of feature 1",),
            "variables": ("Variable details for feature 1",),
            "version": 2
        },
        {
            "factor_name": "feature2",
            "factor_description": ("Description of feature 2",),
            "factor_formulation": ("Formulation of feature 2",),
            "variables": ("Variable details for feature 2",),
            "version": 2
        }
    ],
    "based_experiments": [
        {
            "sub_tasks": [],
            "source_feature_size": 10
        },
        {
            "sub_tasks": [],
            "source_feature_size": 5
        }
    ]
}

### FunctionDef convert_model_experiment(self, response, trace)
**convert_model_experiment**: This function processes a response string containing model-related information and converts it into a structured `KGModelExperiment` object, which includes details about the model tasks and experiments based on the provided trace.

parameters:
· response: A JSON-formatted string that contains information about the model type, name, description, architecture, hyperparameters, and other relevant details.
· trace: An instance of the `Trace` class that holds historical data and context necessary for constructing the experiment.

Code Description: The function begins by parsing the `response` string into a dictionary using `json.loads()`. It then initializes an empty list named `tasks` to store model tasks. The `model_type` is extracted from the response dictionary, with a default value provided if it's not present. If the `model_type` is either not a string or does not match any key in the predefined `KG_SELECT_MAPPING`, a `ModelEmptyError` is raised.

The function then constructs a list of base experiments by starting with an initial experiment created from the input shape found in the trace object, followed by any historical experiments that have been marked as relevant (indicated by the third element being True in each tuple within `trace.hist`). The `model_type` is checked again against `KG_MODEL_MAPPING`, and if it exists, the corresponding base code is retrieved from the last experiment's workspace. If not, `base_code` is set to None.

A new `ModelTask` object is created using the information extracted from the response dictionary, including the model name, description, architecture, hyperparameters, type, version, and base code. This task is appended to the `tasks` list. Finally, a `KGModelExperiment` object is instantiated with the constructed tasks and base experiments, which is then returned.

Note: This function is typically called within the context of converting responses related to model feature selection or tuning actions as part of a larger workflow managed by the `convert_response` method in the same class.

Output Example: A possible return value from this function could be:
```
KGModelExperiment(
    sub_tasks=[
        ModelTask(
            name="Neural Network Classifier",
            description="A neural network model for classification tasks.",
            architecture="Dense layers with ReLU activation functions and a softmax output layer.",
            hyperparameters={"learning_rate": 0.01, "epochs": 50},
            model_type="neural_network",
            version=2,
            base_code="def build_model(input_shape):\n    model = Sequential([...])\n    return model"
        )
    ],
    based_experiments=[
        KGModelExperiment(sub_tasks=[], source_feature_size=10),
        # other historical experiments...
    ]
)

### FunctionDef convert_response(self, response, trace)
**convert_response**: This function processes a response string based on the current action of an experiment and converts it into a structured `ModelExperiment` object. It delegates the conversion process to either `convert_feature_experiment` or `convert_model_experiment`, depending on whether the current action pertains to feature engineering/processing or model feature selection/tuning.

**parameters**:
· response: A string containing JSON data that describes various aspects of an experiment, such as features or models.
· trace: An instance of the `Trace` class, which provides contextual information about the experiment's history and input shape.

Code Description: The function starts by checking the value of `self.current_action`. If it matches any action related to feature engineering (`KG_ACTION_FEATURE_ENGINEERING`) or processing (`KG_ACTION_FEATURE_PROCESSING`), it calls `convert_feature_experiment` with the response string and trace object. This method is responsible for handling responses that describe features, their formulations, and variables.

If `self.current_action` indicates actions related to model feature selection (`KG_ACTION_MODEL_FEATURE_SELECTION`) or model tuning (`KG_ACTION_MODEL_TUNING`), the function instead calls `convert_model_experiment`. This method processes responses containing information about models, including their types, names, descriptions, architectures, hyperparameters, and other relevant details.

Note: The function plays a crucial role in directing the conversion of textual responses into structured experimental data. It ensures that the appropriate processing logic is applied based on the current action within an experiment workflow.

Output Example: A possible return value from this function could be either a `KGFactorExperiment` or a `KGModelExperiment`, depending on the current action. Here are examples for both:

For feature-related actions:

## ClassDef KGTrace
**KGTrace**: This class represents a trace object specifically designed for scenarios involving knowledge graphs (KG). It inherits from a generic `Trace` class, which is parameterized to work with `KGScenario` and `KGKnowledgeGraph` types.

attributes:
· No explicit attributes are defined in the provided code snippet. The class inherits any attributes from its parent class `Trace`.

**Code Description**: The `KGTrace` class is a specialized version of the more general `Trace` class, tailored for use with knowledge graph-related scenarios and knowledge graphs themselves. By inheriting from `Trace`, it likely gains functionality related to tracking or logging events, changes, or states within a knowledge graph scenario. This could include methods for recording actions taken during data processing, monitoring performance metrics, or capturing the evolution of the knowledge graph over time.

The class is currently defined without any additional methods or attributes, suggesting that its primary purpose is to serve as a container or placeholder for functionality provided by the `Trace` class when used with `KGScenario` and `KGKnowledgeGraph`. Developers can extend this class by adding custom methods or overriding existing ones from the parent class to implement specific tracing behaviors relevant to their knowledge graph applications.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where detailed tracking of operations on a knowledge graph is necessary, such as in debugging complex data processing pipelines, monitoring system performance, or auditing changes made to the knowledge graph. Developers should ensure that any additional methods added to `KGTrace` are consistent with the overall design and functionality of the parent `Trace` class to maintain compatibility and coherence within their application.
