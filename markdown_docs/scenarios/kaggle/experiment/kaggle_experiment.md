## ClassDef KGModelExperiment
**KGModelExperiment**: This class represents an experiment setup specifically designed for knowledge graph (KG) models within a Kaggle competition context. It inherits from `ModelExperiment` and is parameterized to work with `ModelTask`, `KGFBWorkspace`, and `ModelFBWorkspace`. The class initializes the experiment workspace, handles data descriptions, and optionally injects code from previous experiments.

**attributes**:
· source_feature_size: An integer representing the size of the original features. This parameter is optional.
· *args: Variable length argument list passed to the superclass constructor.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments passed to the superclass constructor.

**Code Description**: The `KGModelExperiment` class begins by calling its superclass's initializer with any positional and keyword arguments it receives. It then sets up an experiment workspace using `KGFBWorkspace`. The path for this workspace is constructed based on the current file's location, a template path defined in `KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING`, and the competition name also specified in `KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING`.

If there are any base experiments provided (indicated by checking the length of `self.based_experiments`), it injects code from the last experiment into the new workspace. This is done using the `inject_code` method of `KGFBWorkspace`, which takes a dictionary of code snippets from the previous experiment's workspace.

Additionally, if base experiments are present, the data description from the last experiment is deep-copied to ensure that any modifications in the current experiment do not affect the original data description. If no base experiments exist, it initializes the `data_description` attribute with a tuple containing information about the original features and their size, as specified by `source_feature_size`.

**Note**: Usage points include initializing this class when setting up a new KG model experiment within a Kaggle competition framework. Developers should ensure that `KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING` is properly configured with the correct template path and competition name. The optional parameter `source_feature_size` should be provided if the size of the original features needs to be explicitly defined in the data description.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the KGModelExperiment class, setting up an experiment workspace and optionally injecting code and data description from previous experiments.

parameters:
· *args: Variable length argument list passed to the superclass constructor.
· source_feature_size (int): The size of the original features. This parameter is optional and defaults to None if not provided.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments passed to the superclass constructor.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __init__ method begins by calling the constructor of its superclass using super().__init__(*args, **kwargs), allowing it to inherit any initialization logic from the parent class. It then initializes an experiment workspace, represented by the KGFBWorkspace object. The path for this workspace is constructed dynamically based on the location of the current file and settings defined in KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING, specifically template_path and competition.

If there are previous experiments stored in self.based_experiments (a list that presumably holds instances of similar experiments), the method proceeds to inject code from the last experiment in this list into the new workspace. This is done using the inject_code method of KGFBWorkspace, which takes a dictionary of code snippets as an argument. The data description for the new experiment is also copied from the last experiment using deepcopy to ensure that changes to one do not affect the other.

In the absence of any previous experiments (i.e., when self.based_experiments is empty), the method initializes the data description with a default entry. This entry consists of a tuple containing task information about "Original features" and the size of these features, which is provided by the source_feature_size parameter. The FactorTask class is used to generate this task information, specifying the name, description, and formulation of the factor.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should ensure that KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING contains the necessary configuration for template_path and competition when creating an instance of KGModelExperiment. Additionally, if source_feature_size is not provided, it will default to None, which might lead to unexpected behavior depending on how this attribute is used elsewhere in the class or related classes. It's crucial to manage previous experiments correctly if code injection and data description copying are intended functionalities.

## ClassDef KGFactorExperiment
**KGFactorExperiment**: This class represents an experiment setup specifically designed for factor-based tasks within a knowledge graph (KG) context, inheriting from a more generic `FeatureExperiment` class. It initializes with parameters that define its workspace and optionally accepts a source feature size.

**attributes**:
· *source_feature_size*: An optional integer parameter indicating the size of the original features used in the experiment. If not provided, it defaults to None.

**Code Description**: The `KGFactorExperiment` class extends `FeatureExperiment`, which is parameterized with specific types: `FactorTask`, `KGFBWorkspace`, and `FactorFBWorkspace`. Upon initialization (`__init__` method), it first calls the constructor of its superclass using `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed.

The experiment's workspace is then instantiated as a `KGFBWorkspace` object. The path for this workspace is constructed by resolving the current file's location and appending paths specified in `KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING.template_path` and `KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING.competition`. This setup allows the experiment to have a dedicated directory structure within the project.

If there are any base experiments provided (indicated by checking the length of `self.based_experiments`), the code dictionary from the last base experiment's workspace is injected into the current experiment's workspace using `inject_code()`. Additionally, the data description from the last base experiment is deep-copied to ensure that changes in one do not affect the other. This mechanism facilitates the chaining of experiments where subsequent experiments can build upon or modify the results and configurations of previous ones.

If no base experiments are present (i.e., `self.based_experiments` is empty), a default data description is created. It includes a tuple containing task information from a `FactorTask` object initialized with specific attributes (`factor_name`, `factor_description`, `factor_formulation`) and the provided `source_feature_size`. This setup ensures that even in the absence of base experiments, the experiment has a foundational understanding of its input features.

**Note**: Usage points include initializing this class when setting up a new factor-based experiment within a KG context. Developers should ensure that the necessary settings (`KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING.template_path` and `KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING.competition`) are correctly configured to point to valid paths in their project structure. Additionally, if chaining experiments, developers must provide a list of base experiments from which configurations and data descriptions can be inherited.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: Initializes a KGFactorExperiment object, setting up its workspace and data description based on provided arguments and configurations.

parameters:
· *args: Variable length argument list that is passed to the superclass constructor.
· source_feature_size (int): Optional parameter indicating the size of the original features. Defaults to None if not provided.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments that are also passed to the superclass constructor.

Code Description: The function begins by calling the constructor of its superclass using `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`, ensuring any initialization logic in the parent class is executed. It then initializes an `experiment_workspace` attribute with a new instance of `KGFBWorkspace`. This workspace is configured with paths derived from the current file's location and settings specified in `KAGGLE_IMPLEMENT_SETTING`.

The path for the template folder within the workspace is constructed by resolving the relative path from the current file to the template directory, further appending the competition name. If there are any base experiments provided (indicated by a non-empty `based_experiments` list), the function injects code and data description from the last experiment in this list into the new workspace. This allows for chaining or extending previous experiments.

If no base experiments are present, the function initializes the `data_description` attribute with a default entry. This entry includes information about the original features, described through an instance of `FactorTask`. The task details include a name, description, and formulation (which is empty in this case), along with the size of the source features provided via `source_feature_size`.

Note: Usage points include providing necessary arguments to set up the experiment workspace correctly. If extending from previous experiments, ensure that `based_experiments` contains valid experiment objects. The `source_feature_size` should be specified when initializing if there are no base experiments to inherit this information from.
