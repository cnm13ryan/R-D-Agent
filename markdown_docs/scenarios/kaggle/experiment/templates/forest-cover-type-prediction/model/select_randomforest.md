## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes that all features in the DataFrame are relevant and returns them as they are. However, the function is structured to accommodate future feature selection logic if needed.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is 1. If true, it implies that the column names are simple and do not contain multi-level indexing, so the function returns the DataFrame as is. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns (hierarchical), the function flattens these column names by joining each level with an underscore ('_') to create a single-level index for the columns. This process involves iterating over each column name, converting it to a string, and then joining its parts with underscores. After processing, the function returns the DataFrame with the updated column names.

Note: The current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection but is designed to be easily modified to include such functionality in the future. Developers can expand this function by adding logic that evaluates the importance of features and selects only those deemed relevant for model training or prediction.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns like (('feature1', 'subfeat1'), ('feature2', 'subfeat2')), the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names such as ['feature1_subfeat1', 'feature2_subfeat2']. If the input DataFrame already has single-level column names, it will be returned unchanged.
