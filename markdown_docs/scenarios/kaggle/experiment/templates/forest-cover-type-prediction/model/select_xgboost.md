## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single-level or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all columns are relevant features. If `X` contains multi-level column names, the function flattens these into a single level by joining each tuple of column levels with an underscore `_`. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over `X.columns.values`, converting each tuple to a string and stripping any extra whitespace. The modified column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`, and the updated DataFrame is returned.

Note: While the function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic by handling multi-level columns. Developers can extend this function to include actual feature selection techniques as needed.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level column names such as `[('feature', 'type1'), ('feature', 'type2')]`, the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names like `['feature_type1', 'feature_type2']`. If `X` already has single-level columns, it will return unchanged.
