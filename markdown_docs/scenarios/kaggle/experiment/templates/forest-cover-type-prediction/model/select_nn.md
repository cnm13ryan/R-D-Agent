## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given pandas DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset. It may have either single-level or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all features are relevant. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns, the function flattens these into single-level columns. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column levels into a single string separated by underscores and then stripping any leading or trailing whitespace from these strings. The modified DataFrame with flattened column names is then returned.

Note: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic to be implemented. Additionally, the handling of multi-level columns ensures compatibility with datasets that may have been pre-processed in ways that introduce multiple levels of column names.

Output Example: If `X` is a DataFrame with multi-level columns such as:

| ('feature', 'type_1') | ('feature', 'type_2') |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| 0.5                   | 0.3                   |
| 0.7                   | 0.6                   |

The function will return a DataFrame with single-level columns named as follows:

| feature_type_1 | feature_type_2 |
|----------------|----------------|
| 0.5            | 0.3            |
| 0.7            | 0.6            |
