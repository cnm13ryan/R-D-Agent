## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected. It can have either single or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If this condition is true, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns (features) are relevant for further processing. However, if the DataFrame has multi-level column names, the function proceeds to flatten these into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over `X.columns.values`, converting each tuple of column names into a string where individual levels are joined. The resulting list of flattened column names is then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the function returns the modified DataFrame with single-level column names.

Note: While this function currently does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for handling multi-level column names which can be expanded in future iterations to include more sophisticated feature selection logic.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns such as `pd.DataFrame({('a', 'b'): [1, 2], ('c', 'd'): [3, 4]})`, the output will be a DataFrame with single-level column names like `pd.DataFrame({'a_b': [1, 2], 'c_d': [3, 4]})`. If all columns are already at a single level, the output will be identical to the input.
