## FunctionDef compute_metrics_for_classification(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_metrics_for_classification**: This function computes the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for a classification task. The MCC is a measure of the quality of binary classifications, providing insight into the balance between precision and recall.

parameters:
路 y_true: A list or array-like structure containing the true class labels.
路 y_pred: A list or array-like structure containing the predicted class labels from the model.

Code Description: The function takes two main arguments, `y_true` and `y_pred`, which represent the actual and predicted class labels respectively. It calculates the Matthews Correlation Coefficient using the `matthews_corrcoef` function from a library (presumably scikit-learn, given the context). The MCC is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets as it considers true and false positives and negatives, providing a more balanced measure than accuracy alone.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where binary classification performance needs to be evaluated, especially in cases of class imbalance. It's important that `y_true` and `y_pred` are aligned correctly, meaning they should correspond to the same instances.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If `y_true = [0, 1, 0, 1]` and `y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 0]`, the function might return an MCC value close to 0.57, indicating a moderate level of correlation between the true and predicted classifications. The exact value can vary based on rounding and the precision of the underlying implementation.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path using the `importlib` library. It is particularly useful when working with modular codebases where modules need to be loaded programmatically rather than statically.

**parameters**:
路 module_name: A string representing the name of the module that will be imported. This name does not have to match the filename but should follow Python's naming conventions for modules.
路 module_path: A string representing the file path to the Python file containing the module. This path can be absolute or relative.

**Code Description**: The function starts by creating a specification (spec) object using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`. This spec object contains all necessary information about the module, such as its location and name. Next, it creates an empty module object from this spec with `importlib.util.module_from_spec`. Afterward, the function executes the code in the specified file within the context of the newly created module using `spec.loader.exec_module(module)`, effectively loading the module's contents into memory. Finally, the fully loaded module is returned.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where modules are generated at runtime or when working with plugins that reside outside a project's main package structure. This function allows for flexible and dynamic code loading, enhancing modularity and maintainability of applications.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming there is a file located at `/path/to/my_module.py` containing:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello from my module!")
```
Calling `import_module_from_path('my_custom_name', '/path/to/my_module.py')` would return a module object that can be used as follows:
```python
loaded_module = import_module_from_path('my_custom_name', '/path/to/my_module.py')
loaded_module.greet()  # Outputs: Hello from my module!
```
In this example, `loaded_module` is the dynamically imported module, and its function `greet()` can be called just like any other function in a statically imported module.
