## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path. It allows users to load modules at runtime, which can be particularly useful for plugins, extensions, or when working with modular codebases where the structure is not known until execution time.

**parameters**:
· module_name: A string representing the name of the module you wish to import. This name does not need to match the filename but should be a valid Python identifier.
· module_path: A string representing the file path to the Python file containing the module you want to import.

**Code Description**: The function utilizes the `importlib.util` module, which provides support for importing modules using a loader-independent API. Here's how it works step-by-step:
1. `spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(module_name, module_path)`: This line creates a module specification from the given file path and name. The specification contains all the necessary information about the module that Python needs to load it.
2. `module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)`: Using the specification created in the previous step, this line creates a new module based on the spec. At this point, the module is not yet loaded; it's just an empty shell with the correct name and attributes.
3. `spec.loader.exec_module(module)`: This command executes the module in its own namespace, effectively loading it into memory. The loader associated with the specification reads the file at `module_path`, compiles it if necessary, and runs it to populate the module's namespace.
4. `return module`: Finally, the function returns the newly loaded module object, which can then be used like any other imported module in Python.

**Note**: This approach is particularly useful when you need to load modules dynamically based on user input or configuration files. It allows for more flexible and modular code structures but should be used with caution as it can introduce security risks if not properly managed (e.g., loading untrusted code).

**Output Example**: If there were a Python file located at `/path/to/my_module.py` containing the following code:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
Using `import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')` would result in a module object that can be used as follows:
```python
loaded_module = import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')
print(loaded_module.greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```
This demonstrates how the function can dynamically load and utilize code from arbitrary file paths.
