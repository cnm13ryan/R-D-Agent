## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic for handling multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. If the DataFrame contains multi-level columns (hierarchical column structure), the function flattens these into single-level columns. This is achieved by joining each tuple of multi-level column names into a single string with underscores separating the levels. The modified DataFrame with flattened column names is then returned.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where feature selection logic might be implemented in place of the current assumption that all features are relevant. Additionally, this function can be particularly useful when dealing with datasets that have complex hierarchical structures and require simplification for further processing or modeling steps.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns:
```
         A             B
       C  D          E  F
0      1  2          3  4
1      5  6          7  8
```

The function will output a DataFrame with flattened column names:
```
   A_C  A_D  B_E  B_F
0    1    2    3    4
1    5    6    7    8
```
