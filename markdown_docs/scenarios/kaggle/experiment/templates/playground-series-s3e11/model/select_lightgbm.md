## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single-level or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is 1, indicating that all columns already have single-level names. If this condition is met, it returns the DataFrame `X` as is. Otherwise, it proceeds to flatten any multi-level column names into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column names (which can occur in multi-level DataFrames) into a single string with underscores separating the original levels. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to the DataFrame `X`, which is subsequently returned.

Note: While this function currently does not perform any actual feature selection, it provides a framework for future enhancements where specific criteria could be applied to select relevant features. Additionally, handling multi-level columns ensures compatibility with datasets that may have been pre-processed or imported in a way that results in such column structures.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns like (('feature', 'type'), ('value',)), the function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names such as ['feature_type', 'value']. If all columns are already single-level, it simply returns the original DataFrame without any modifications.
