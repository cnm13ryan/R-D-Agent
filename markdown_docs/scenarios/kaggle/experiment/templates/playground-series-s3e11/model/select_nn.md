## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes that all features in the DataFrame are relevant. However, the function can be expanded to include more sophisticated feature selection logic if needed.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset with potential features for model training or prediction.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is 1. If this condition is met, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns are relevant and properly formatted. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns (hierarchical column names), the function flattens these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This process involves converting each column name to a string, joining them if they consist of multiple parts, and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The modified DataFrame is then returned.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where the dataset might have hierarchical columns that need to be flattened for processing by machine learning models. Although the function currently does not perform actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for future enhancements in this area.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns like:
```
         A        B
       1 2      3 4
0     10 20    30 40
1     50 60    70 80
```

The function would return a DataFrame with flattened column names:
```
   A_1  A_2  B_3  B_4
0   10   20   30   40
1   50   60   70   80
```
