## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame. It is intended to be used within fit and predict functions, potentially as part of a preprocessing pipeline for machine learning models.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If this condition is met, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns (features) are relevant for further processing. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names, the function flattens these names into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This flattened DataFrame is then returned.

**Note**: The current implementation assumes that all features are relevant, which might not be the case in practice. Future enhancements could include more sophisticated feature selection logic to improve model performance.

**Output Example**: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns such as `pd.DataFrame({('a', 'b'): [1, 2], ('c', 'd'): [3, 4]})`, the function will return a DataFrame with single-level column names like `pd.DataFrame({'a_b': [1, 2], 'c_d': [3, 4]})`. If all columns are already at a single level, the output will be identical to the input.
