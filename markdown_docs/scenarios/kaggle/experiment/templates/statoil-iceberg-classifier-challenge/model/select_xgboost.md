## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame. It is intended to be used within fit and predict functions, potentially as part of a preprocessing pipeline for machine learning models.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected or processed.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function assumes all columns (features) are relevant and returns the DataFrame as is. This assumption can be modified in future iterations to include feature selection logic. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names, the function flattens these by joining each tuple of column names into a single string separated by underscores. It then strips any leading or trailing whitespace from these new column names before returning the modified DataFrame.

Note: The current implementation does not perform actual feature selection but rather handles the case where the input DataFrame has multi-level columns by flattening them. This is useful for ensuring compatibility with models that expect a single level of column names.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns such as `pd.DataFrame({('band_1', 'mean'): [0.5], ('band_2', 'std'): [0.3]})`, the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names like `pd.DataFrame({'band_1_mean': [0.5], 'band_2_std': [0.3]})`. If all columns are already at a single level, the output will simply mirror the input DataFrame without any changes.
