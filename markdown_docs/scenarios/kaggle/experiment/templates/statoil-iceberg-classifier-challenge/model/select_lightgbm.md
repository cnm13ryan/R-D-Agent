## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes that all features in the DataFrame are relevant and returns them as is. However, the function includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's column index is 1. If it is, this indicates that the DataFrame already has a flat structure for its columns, and thus, no further processing is needed; the original DataFrame `X` is returned unchanged. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns (more than one level), the function proceeds to flatten these columns by joining each tuple of column names into a single string separated by underscores. This new set of flattened column names replaces the existing multi-level column structure, and the modified DataFrame is then returned.

Note: The current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection based on relevance or importance; it merely ensures that the DataFrame has a flat column structure. Future enhancements could include more sophisticated feature selection techniques to identify and retain only the most relevant features for modeling purposes.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns such as `[('band_1', 'mean'), ('band_2', 'std')]`, the function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names like `['band_1_mean', 'band_2_std']`. If the input DataFrame already has flat columns, it will be returned unchanged.
