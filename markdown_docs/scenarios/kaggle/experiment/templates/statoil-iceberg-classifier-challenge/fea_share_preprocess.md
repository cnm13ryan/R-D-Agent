## FunctionDef prepreprocess
**prepreprocess**: This method loads the data from JSON files, processes it by reshaping image bands, extracting features, handling missing values, and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The function does not accept any input arguments directly but operates on predefined file paths for loading the data.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `prepreprocess` function begins by loading the training and test datasets from JSON files located at "/kaggle/input/train.json" and "/kaggle/input/test.json", respectively. It immediately removes the "id" column from both datasets, storing the test IDs separately for later use.

Next, a nested function named `process_data` is defined to handle data processing tasks:
- **Reshaping Bands**: Each image band ("band_1" and "band_2") in the dataset is converted into a 75x75 numpy array.
- **Creating Band 3**: A new band, "band_3", is created as an average of "band_1" and "band_2".
- **Feature Extraction**: Mean and maximum values are calculated for each band (including the newly created "band_3") and added as separate features to the dataset.
- **Handling Missing Values**: The function replaces any occurrences of "na" in the "inc_angle" column with NaN, converts the column to a float type, and fills missing values with the mean of the existing angles.

After processing both training and test datasets using `process_data`, the function separates the target variable ("is_iceberg") from the features for the training set. It then removes the original image bands from both the training and test sets as they are no longer needed after feature extraction.

Finally, the training dataset is split into training and validation subsets with an 80-20 ratio using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn, ensuring reproducibility by setting a random state. The function returns the preprocessed training features (`X_train`), validation features (`X_valid`), corresponding target labels for both sets (`y_train`, `y_valid`), and the processed test features along with their original IDs.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used as an initial step in a machine learning pipeline to prepare data for model training. It encapsulates all necessary preprocessing steps, making it easy to integrate into larger scripts or workflows. The output of this function can be directly fed into various machine learning algorithms for training and evaluation purposes.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The function returns six objects:
- `X_train`: A pandas DataFrame containing 80% of the preprocessed training features.
- `X_valid`: A pandas DataFrame containing 20% of the preprocessed training features, used for validation.
- `y_train`: A pandas Series containing the target labels corresponding to `X_train`.
- `y_valid`: A pandas Series containing the target labels corresponding to `X_valid`.
- `X_test`: A pandas DataFrame containing all preprocessed test features.
- `test_ids`: A pandas Series or array containing the original IDs of the test samples.

Each DataFrame/Series will have specific columns and rows depending on the dataset's size and the preprocessing steps applied. For instance, `X_train` might look like this:

| band_1_mean | band_2_mean | band_3_mean | band_1_max | band_2_max | band_3_max | inc_angle |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| 0.5         | 0.4         | 0.45        | 0.8        | 0.7        | 0.75       | 20.0      |
| ...         | ...         | ...         | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...       |

And `y_train` might look like this:

| is_iceberg |
|------------|
| 1          |
| ...        |
### FunctionDef process_data(df)
**process_data**: This function processes a DataFrame containing radar imagery data from the Kaggle Statoil Iceberg Classifier Challenge. It reshapes image bands, calculates additional features, and handles missing values for incidence angles.

parameters:
· df: A pandas DataFrame that includes columns 'band_1', 'band_2', and 'inc_angle'. The 'band_1' and 'band_2' columns contain lists of pixel intensity values representing radar images. The 'inc_angle' column contains the incidence angle at which the radar signal was collected.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by creating a copy of the input DataFrame to avoid modifying the original data. It then reshapes the 'band_1' and 'band_2' columns from lists into 75x75 numpy arrays, representing the radar images in a structured format suitable for further processing.

A new column 'band_3' is created by averaging the values of 'band_1' and 'band_2'. This step combines information from both bands to potentially enhance feature extraction.

The function proceeds to calculate statistical features such as mean and maximum pixel intensity for each band, including the newly created 'band_3'. These features are stored in new columns ('band_1_mean', 'band_2_mean', 'band_3_mean', 'band_1_max', 'band_2_max', 'band_3_max') within the DataFrame. Calculating these statistics provides a summary of the image data, which can be useful for machine learning models.

Handling missing values is an important step in data preprocessing. The function replaces any occurrence of "na" in the 'inc_angle' column with numpy's NaN value and converts the entire column to float type. It then fills any remaining NaN values with the mean incidence angle from the dataset, ensuring that all entries have a valid numerical value for this feature.

Note: Usage points.
This function is particularly useful when preparing data for machine learning models in image classification tasks. By reshaping images into arrays and calculating additional features, it transforms raw pixel data into a format more suitable for analysis. Handling missing values ensures the dataset's integrity, preventing issues during model training.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The output DataFrame might look like this:

| band_1 (75x75 array) | band_2 (75x75 array) | band_3 (75x75 array) | band_1_mean | band_2_mean | band_3_mean | band_1_max | band_2_max | band_3_max | inc_angle |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| [[...]]              | [[...]]              | [[...]]              | 0.5         | 0.4         | 0.45        | 1.2        | 1.3        | 1.25       | 37.5      |
| [[...]]              | [[...]]              | [[...]]              | 0.6         | 0.5         | 0.55        | 1.4        | 1.5        | 1.45       | 42.0      |

Each row in the DataFrame represents a different radar image, with additional columns providing calculated features and cleaned incidence angle data.

## FunctionDef preprocess_script
**preprocess_script**: This method applies preprocessing steps to the training, validation, and test datasets. It checks if preprocessed data files already exist; if they do, it loads them directly. If not, it calls the `prepreprocess` function to preprocess the data from scratch, then saves the results for future use.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The function does not accept any input arguments directly but operates on predefined file paths for loading and saving the data.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `preprocess_script` function first checks if preprocessed data files ("X_train.pkl", "X_valid.pkl", "y_train.pkl", "y_valid.pkl", "X_test.pkl", "test_ids.pkl") already exist in the current directory. If these files are found, it loads them using pandas' `read_pickle` method and returns the loaded datasets immediately.

If the preprocessed data files do not exist, the function calls another function named `prepreprocess`. This function is responsible for loading raw data from JSON files, processing it by reshaping image bands, extracting features, handling missing values, and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets. After obtaining the processed datasets from `prepreprocess`, `preprocess_script` saves each of them to a pickle file using pandas' `to_pickle` method for future use.

The function then returns the preprocessed datasets: `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, `y_valid`, `X_test`, and `test_ids`. These datasets are ready for further steps in the machine learning pipeline, such as model training and evaluation.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used as an initial step in a machine learning workflow to ensure that data preprocessing is handled efficiently. By checking for existing preprocessed files, it avoids redundant processing and speeds up subsequent runs of the script. The output datasets can be directly fed into various machine learning algorithms for training and evaluation purposes.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The function returns six objects:
- `X_train`: A pandas DataFrame containing 80% of the preprocessed training features.
- `X_valid`: A pandas DataFrame containing 20% of the preprocessed training features, used for validation.
- `y_train`: A pandas Series containing the target labels corresponding to `X_train`.
- `y_valid`: A pandas Series containing the target labels corresponding to `X_valid`.
- `X_test`: A pandas DataFrame containing all preprocessed test features.
- `test_ids`: A pandas Series or array containing the original IDs of the test samples.

Each DataFrame/Series will have specific columns and rows depending on the dataset's size and the preprocessing steps applied. For instance, `X_train` might look like this:

| band_1_mean | band_2_mean | band_3_mean | band_1_max | band_2_max | band_3_max | inc_angle |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| 0.5         | 0.4         | 0.45        | 0.8        | 0.7        | 0.75       | 20.0      |
| ...         | ...         | ...         | ...        | ...        | ...        | ...       |

And `y_train` might look like this:

| is_iceberg |
|------------|
| 1          |
| ...        |
