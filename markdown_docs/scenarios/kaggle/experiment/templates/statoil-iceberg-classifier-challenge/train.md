## FunctionDef compute_metrics_for_classification(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_metrics_for_classification**: This function calculates the log loss metric for a classification problem, which quantifies the performance of a classification model where the prediction input is a probability value between 0 and 1.

parameters:
路 y_true: The true binary labels in the dataset, represented as a list or array of integers (typically 0 or 1).
路 y_pred: The predicted probabilities by the classifier for each sample, also represented as a list or array of floats. Each element should be between 0 and 1.

Code Description: The function takes two main inputs - the true labels and the predicted probabilities from a classification model. It then computes the log loss using these inputs. Log loss is particularly useful in evaluating models where the output is a probability rather than a hard classification, as it penalizes false classifications more heavily when the confidence of the prediction is high.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where you need to assess the performance of a binary classifier and want a metric that reflects both the accuracy and the confidence of predictions. It's important that y_pred contains probabilities, not class labels, for accurate computation of log loss.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given:
y_true = [0, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [0.2, 0.8, 0.3, 0.7]

The function call compute_metrics_for_classification(y_true, y_pred) might return a float value such as 0.4581496109142295, indicating the log loss for these predictions. Lower values of log loss indicate better model performance.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path. It utilizes the `importlib` library to create a module specification, instantiate the module, and execute it within the current environment.

parameters:
路 module_name: A string representing the name of the module you wish to import. This name is used internally by Python to reference the module.
路 module_path: A string indicating the file system path to the Python file containing the module code that needs to be imported.

Code Description: The function begins by creating a module specification using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location()`. This function takes two arguments: the name of the module and its location (file path). It returns a module specification object which contains all necessary information about the module, such as its file location and loader.

Next, `importlib.util.module_from_spec()` is called with the previously created specification. This function generates a new module based on the provided specification. The resulting module object is not yet initialized; it merely represents an empty shell of the module that will be populated with code from the specified file.

The final step in the process involves executing the module's code within its own namespace using `spec.loader.exec_module(module)`. This method takes the uninitialized module and runs all top-level code contained within the specified Python file, effectively populating the module object with functions, classes, variables, etc., as defined in the file.

The function concludes by returning the fully initialized module object. This allows the caller to use the imported module just like any other module that has been statically imported using standard import statements.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where modules are not known until runtime or when working with plugins or extensions that reside outside of a project's main package structure. It is important to ensure that the provided file path leads to a valid Python file and that the module name does not conflict with existing names in the current namespace to avoid unexpected behavior.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming there is a Python file located at '/path/to/my_module.py' which contains:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello from my_module!")
```
Calling `import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')` would return a module object that can be used as follows:
```python
imported_module = import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')
imported_module.greet()  # Outputs: Hello from my_module!
```
This demonstrates how the dynamically imported module behaves identically to a statically imported one.
