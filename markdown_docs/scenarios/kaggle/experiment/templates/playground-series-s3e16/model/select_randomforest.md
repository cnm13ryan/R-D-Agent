## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes that all features within the DataFrame are relevant and returns them as is. However, the function also includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns (`X.columns.nlevels`) is equal to 1. If this condition is true, it implies that the DataFrame already has single-level column names, and thus, all features are returned without any modification. If the DataFrame contains multi-level column names (hierarchical), the function proceeds to flatten these columns by joining each tuple of column levels into a single string separated by underscores. This transformation ensures that the resulting DataFrame has only single-level column names, which can be more convenient for subsequent processing steps such as model fitting and prediction.

Note: Although the current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework where feature selection logic could be integrated in future iterations. Additionally, handling multi-level columns is an important preprocessing step that ensures compatibility with many machine learning models which expect single-level column names.

Output Example: Given a DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns such as:

| ('feature', 'A') | ('feature', 'B') |
|------------------|------------------|
| 1                | 2                |
| 3                | 4                |

The function would return:

| feature_A | feature_B |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 2         |
| 3         | 4         |
