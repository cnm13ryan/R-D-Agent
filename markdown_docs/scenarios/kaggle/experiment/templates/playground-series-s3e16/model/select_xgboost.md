## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame. It currently assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated strings.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected or processed.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If this condition is met, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. However, if the DataFrame contains multi-level columns (hierarchical column structure), the function flattens these columns into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column labels into a single string separated by underscores. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to the DataFrame before it is returned.

Note: While the function currently does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a mechanism for handling multi-level columns, which can be useful in preprocessing steps of data analysis or machine learning pipelines.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns like this:

| ('feature', 'A') | ('feature', 'B') |
|------------------|------------------|
| 1                | 2                |
| 3                | 4                |

The function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names:

| feature_A | feature_B |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 2         |
| 3         | 4         |
