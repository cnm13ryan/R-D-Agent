## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to process a pandas DataFrame by selecting relevant features. It assumes that initially, all features in the DataFrame are considered relevant. However, it includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated strings.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset whose features need to be processed or selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If this condition is met, it simply returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns are relevant and no further processing is needed for feature selection. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names (hierarchical), the function proceeds to flatten these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column labels into a single string separated by underscores. This transformation ensures that the resulting DataFrame has straightforward column names, which can be more manageable and compatible with various machine learning models.

Note: The current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection based on statistical or model-based criteria; it merely handles multi-level columns. Developers are encouraged to expand this function with appropriate feature selection logic if needed for their specific use case.

Output Example: Given a DataFrame `X` with multi-level column names like (('feature1', 'subfeat1'), ('feature2', 'subfeat2')), the function would return a DataFrame with flattened column names such as 'feature1_subfeat1' and 'feature2_subfeat2'. If `X` already has single-level columns, it will be returned unchanged.
