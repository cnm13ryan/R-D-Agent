## FunctionDef fit(X_train, y_train, X_valid, y_valid)
**fit**: Define and train an XGBoost regression model using specified training and validation datasets.
parameters:
· X_train: A pandas DataFrame containing the features of the training dataset.
· y_train: A pandas DataFrame containing the target variable for the training dataset.
· X_valid: A pandas DataFrame containing the features of the validation dataset.
· y_valid: A pandas DataFrame containing the target variable for the validation dataset.

Code Description: The function initializes an XGBoost regressor with a set of predefined hyperparameters. These parameters include the number of trees (n_estimators), learning rate, maximum depth of each tree, subsample ratio of the training instances, feature sampling ratio, tree construction algorithm, categorical data handling, verbosity level, minimum child weight, base score, and random state for reproducibility. The model is then trained using the provided training dataset (X_train and y_train). Although X_valid and y_valid are included in the function signature, they are not utilized within the current implementation of the function. After training, the fitted model object is returned.

Note: Developers should ensure that the input DataFrames (X_train, y_train, X_valid, y_valid) are preprocessed appropriately before being passed to this function. The validation dataset parameters (X_valid and y_valid) are currently unused in the function but may be intended for future use or evaluation purposes.

Output Example: An instance of xgb.XGBRegressor that has been trained on the provided training data.
Example:

## FunctionDef predict(model, X_test)
**predict**: This function takes a trained machine learning model and a set of test features to produce predictions. It ensures consistency in feature selection by using the same features during prediction as were used during training.

**parameters**:
· model: A trained XGBoost model object that will be used to make predictions.
· X_test: A 2D array-like structure (such as a NumPy array or Pandas DataFrame) containing the test data for which predictions are to be made. Each row represents an instance, and each column represents a feature.

**Code Description**: The function begins by invoking the `predict` method of the provided model object on the test dataset `X_test`. This method computes the predicted values based on the learned patterns from the training phase. After obtaining these predictions, the function reshapes them into a 2D array with one column using the `reshape(-1, 1)` method. The `-1` in the reshape method allows NumPy to automatically determine the number of rows needed to accommodate all the predicted values while ensuring that there is only one column.

**Note**: It's important to ensure that the test data (`X_test`) has been preprocessed in exactly the same way as the training data, including any feature selection or scaling steps. This consistency is crucial for obtaining accurate predictions.

**Output Example**: If `X_test` contains 10 instances and each instance has 5 features, the output of this function will be a NumPy array with shape (10, 1), where each element in the single column represents the predicted value for the corresponding instance in `X_test`. For example:

```
array([[0.234],
       [0.789],
       [0.567],
       [0.123],
       [0.456],
       [0.890],
       [0.345],
       [0.678],
       [0.901],
       [0.012]])
```
