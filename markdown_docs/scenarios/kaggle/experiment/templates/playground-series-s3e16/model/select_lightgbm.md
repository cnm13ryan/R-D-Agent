## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels == 1`. If this condition is true, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns are relevant features. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names, the function proceeds to flatten these names. This is done by iterating over each column name (which is a tuple in the case of multi-level columns), converting each element of the tuple into a string, joining them with underscores, and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The resulting single-level column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the modified DataFrame `X` is returned.

Note: This function currently does not perform actual feature selection based on statistical tests or model performance metrics. It only handles the formatting of multi-level column names into a single level by concatenating them with underscores. Developers can extend this function to include more sophisticated feature selection techniques as needed for their specific use cases.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns such as `[('feature', 'A'), ('feature', 'B')]`, the output will be a DataFrame with single-level column names `['feature_A', 'feature_B']`. If all columns are already at a single level, the output will be identical to the input.
