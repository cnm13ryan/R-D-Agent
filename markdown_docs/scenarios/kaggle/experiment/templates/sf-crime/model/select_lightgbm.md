## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but can be expanded to include more sophisticated feature selection logic if needed.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset with potential features for model training or prediction. The columns of this DataFrame may have multi-level indices.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level index for its columns. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all columns are relevant features. If the DataFrame's column index has multiple levels (a MultiIndex), the function flattens these multi-level indices into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This transformation ensures that the resulting DataFrame can be used in subsequent steps where only single-level column names are expected.

Note: Usage points include preparing data for machine learning models, especially when dealing with datasets that have complex or hierarchical feature representations. The function's current implementation is a placeholder and may need to be adapted based on specific feature selection criteria.

Output Example: Mock up of the code's return value

Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns:
```
         A          B
       C  D        E  F
0      1  2        3  4
1      5  6        7  8
```

The function will transform it into a DataFrame with single-level column names:
```
   A_C  A_D  B_E  B_F
0    1    2    3    4
1    5    6    7    8
```
