## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame intended for use in machine learning models, specifically within the context of fitting and predicting functions. Currently, it assumes that all features provided in the input DataFrame are relevant and returns them as-is. However, the function includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated strings.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. This DataFrame can have either a single level of column names or multiple levels.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is one, indicating that all columns are already at the base level. If this condition is met, it simply returns the input DataFrame without any modifications. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns (more than one level), the function proceeds to flatten these columns. This is achieved by iterating over each column name, converting each tuple of names into a single string where individual levels are joined with underscores. The resulting list of flattened column names replaces the original multi-level column names in the DataFrame.

**Note**: While this function currently does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for future enhancements that could include more sophisticated feature selection techniques. Additionally, the handling of multi-level columns ensures compatibility with datasets that might have been processed or transformed into such structures.

**Output Example**: Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level column names like `pd.DataFrame({('feature', 'type1'): [1, 2], ('feature', 'type2'): [3, 4]})`, the function would return a DataFrame with flattened column names: `pd.DataFrame({'feature_type1': [1, 2], 'feature_type2': [3, 4]})`. If all columns were already single-level, the output would be identical to the input.
