## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame, intended for use within fit and predict functions of a machine learning model. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected or processed.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant and no further processing is needed for feature selection. However, if the DataFrame contains multi-level columns (hierarchical column structure), the function proceeds to flatten these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column labels with an underscore ('_'). This transformation ensures that the resulting DataFrame has a simpler structure, which can be more easily handled in subsequent steps of data processing or model training.

**Note**: The current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection based on relevance criteria. It merely handles multi-level columns by flattening them. Developers are encouraged to expand this function with appropriate logic for selecting relevant features if necessary.

**Output Example**: Given a DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns such as:

```
       Category
Location  A    B
0         1    2
1         3    4
```

The output of the `select` function would be:

```
   Location_A  Location_B
0           1           2
1           3           4
```
