## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function selects relevant features from a given DataFrame. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but is designed to be expanded for more sophisticated feature selection logic.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is 1. If true, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. If there are multiple levels in the column names (which can happen with MultiIndex DataFrames), it flattens these multi-level column names into single strings by joining each level with an underscore. This flattened DataFrame is then returned.

Note: The function currently does not perform any actual feature selection but provides a framework for future implementation. It ensures that the DataFrame's columns are in a consistent format, which can be crucial for subsequent processing steps such as model training and prediction.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level column names like ('feature1', 'subfeatureA') and ('feature2', 'subfeatureB'), the function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names 'feature1_subfeatureA' and 'feature2_subfeatureB'. Assuming all features are relevant, no columns would be dropped.
