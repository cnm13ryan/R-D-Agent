## FunctionDef compute_metrics_for_classification(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_metrics_for_classification**: This function calculates the log loss metric for a classification problem given true labels and predicted probabilities.

parameters:
路 y_true: An array-like structure containing the true class labels.
路 y_pred: A 2D array-like structure where each row corresponds to an instance and contains the predicted probabilities for all classes.

Code Description: The function begins by defining an array of all possible class indices, which in this case is set from 0 to 38 (inclusive), indicating there are 39 distinct classes. It then computes the log loss using the `log_loss` function from a library such as scikit-learn. Log loss quantifies the accuracy of a classifier where the predicted output is a probability value between 0 and 1. Lower log loss values indicate better performance, with perfect predictions having a log loss of 0.

Note: The function assumes that the `log_loss` function from scikit-learn or a similar library is available in the current namespace. It also assumes that the predicted probabilities for each class are provided in `y_pred`, and these probabilities must sum to 1 for each instance.

Output Example: If `y_true` contains true labels [0, 1, 2] and `y_pred` contains predicted probabilities [[0.7, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]], the function might return a log loss value of approximately 0.462, indicating how well the predicted probabilities align with the true labels.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path. It utilizes the `importlib` library to create a module specification, instantiate the module based on this specification, and then execute it.

parameters:
路 module_name: A string representing the name of the module you wish to import. This is used as an identifier for the module within your program.
路 module_path: A string that specifies the file path to the Python file containing the module you want to import.

Code Description: The function begins by creating a module specification using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`. This step involves generating a specification object that contains information about the module, such as its name and location. Next, it creates an empty module based on this specification with `importlib.util.module_from_spec`. After the module is created, the function executes the code in the specified file to populate the module's namespace using `spec.loader.exec_module(module)`. Finally, the fully loaded module is returned.

Note: This function is particularly useful when you need to import modules dynamically at runtime, especially when the module files are not located in a directory that is part of your Python path. It allows for flexible and dynamic code loading based on file paths provided at runtime.

Output Example: If there were a Python file located at '/path/to/your/module.py' containing a function `greet`, calling `import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/your/module.py')` would return the module object. You could then access the `greet` function from this module using `module.greet()`.
