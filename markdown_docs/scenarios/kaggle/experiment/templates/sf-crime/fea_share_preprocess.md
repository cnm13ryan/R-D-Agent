## FunctionDef prepreprocess
**prepreprocess**: This function loads the training and test datasets from specified CSV files, preprocesses them by dropping unnecessary columns, performs feature engineering to extract relevant date-time features, encodes categorical variables, selects appropriate feature columns for modeling, and splits the training data into training and validation sets.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters are defined. The function operates on predefined file paths and does not accept any arguments directly.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by loading the training dataset from "/kaggle/input/train.csv" and the test dataset from "/kaggle/input/test.csv". It uses pandas' `read_csv` method with the `parse_dates` parameter to convert the "Dates" column into datetime objects. The unnecessary columns 'Descript', 'Resolution', and 'Address' are dropped from the training set, while only 'Address' is removed from the test set to preserve the ID for submission purposes.

A nested function named `feature_engineering` is defined within `prepreprocess`. This function extracts several date-time features such as day, month, year, hour, minute, day of the week, and week of the year from the "Dates" column. These features are added to the dataset as new columns.

The 'PdDistrict' column in both datasets is then encoded using `LabelEncoder` from scikit-learn, converting categorical district names into numerical labels. Similarly, the 'Category' column in the training set is also label-encoded to prepare it for modeling purposes.

Feature columns are selected based on their relevance and importance for predicting crime categories. The 'Minute' feature is excluded as it might not contribute significantly to the model's performance. The resulting features (X) and target variable (y) are separated from the training dataset, while only the relevant features are extracted from the test set.

The `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn is used to split the training data into training and validation sets with an 80/20 ratio. This allows for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data during the development phase.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically called at the beginning of a machine learning pipeline to prepare the datasets for further processing, feature scaling, and modeling. It ensures that the data is clean, relevant features are extracted, and the dataset is split appropriately for training and validation.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The function returns six values:
- X_train: A DataFrame containing the training features (e.g., shape=(150000, 9))
- X_valid: A DataFrame containing the validation features (e.g., shape=(37500, 9))
- y_train: A Series containing the training labels (e.g., shape=(150000,))
- y_valid: A Series containing the validation labels (e.g., shape=(37500,))
- X_test: A DataFrame containing the test features for submission (e.g., shape=(88426, 9))
- category_encoder: The fitted LabelEncoder object used to encode the 'Category' column
- test_ids: A Series containing the IDs of the test samples for submission purposes (e.g., shape=(88426,))
### FunctionDef feature_engineering(data)
**feature_engineering**: This function performs feature engineering on a dataset by extracting various time-related features from a 'Dates' column, which is expected to be in datetime format.

parameters:
· data: A pandas DataFrame containing at least one column named 'Dates', where each entry represents a date and time.

Code Description: The function takes a pandas DataFrame as input. It assumes that the DataFrame has a column named 'Dates' with datetime objects. From this 'Dates' column, it extracts several new features:
- "Day": The day of the month (1 through 31).
- "Month": The month of the year (1 through 12).
- "Year": The four-digit year.
- "Hour": The hour of the day (0 through 23).
- "Minute": The minute of the hour (0 through 59).
- "DayOfWeek": The day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.
- "WeekOfYear": The ISO calendar week number of the year.

Each new feature is added to the DataFrame as a separate column. After all features are extracted and added, the modified DataFrame is returned.

Note: This function is particularly useful in scenarios involving time-series data or any dataset where temporal patterns might influence the outcome. It assumes that the 'Dates' column has already been converted to datetime format using pandas' `pd.to_datetime()` method if it was not originally in this format.

Output Example: Given a DataFrame with a 'Dates' column containing datetime objects, the function will return a DataFrame with additional columns for day, month, year, hour, minute, day of the week, and week of the year. For instance:

Original Data:
| Dates                |
|----------------------|
| 2015-07-31 14:15:00  |
| 2016-08-15 09:30:00  |

Processed Data:
| Dates                | Day | Month | Year | Hour | Minute | DayOfWeek | WeekOfYear |
|----------------------|-----|-------|------|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| 2015-07-31 14:15:00  | 31  | 7     | 2015 | 14   | 15     | 4         | 31         |
| 2016-08-15 09:30:00  | 15  | 8     | 2016 | 9    | 30     | 0         | 33         |

In this example, the 'DayOfWeek' values correspond to Friday (4) and Monday (0), respectively.

## FunctionDef preprocess_fit(X_train)
**preprocess_fit**: This function fits a preprocessor on the training data to handle missing values by imputing them with the mean of each numerical feature, and returns the fitted preprocessor.

parameters:
· X_train: A pandas DataFrame containing the training dataset. All columns are assumed to be numerical features.

Code Description: The function begins by identifying all columns in the provided training dataset as numerical features. It then defines a preprocessing pipeline specifically for these numerical features, which includes an imputer that fills missing values with the mean of each feature. This pipeline is encapsulated within a ColumnTransformer, which applies the defined transformation to the specified columns (all columns in this case). The preprocessor is subsequently fitted on the training data using the `fit` method, preparing it for transforming other datasets (such as validation and test sets) in a consistent manner.

Note: Usage points include fitting the preprocessor on the training dataset before applying transformations to any other datasets. This ensures that all datasets are processed consistently according to the statistics derived from the training set.

Output Example: The function returns a fitted ColumnTransformer object, which can be used to transform datasets using the same preprocessing steps applied during the fit process. For instance:
```
ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('num', Pipeline(steps=[('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='mean'))]), Index(['feature1', 'feature2', ..., 'featureN'], dtype='object'))])
```
## FunctionDef preprocess_transform(X, preprocessor)
**preprocess_transform**: This function applies a transformation to a given DataFrame using a pre-fitted preprocessing object. It is typically used after fitting a preprocessor on training data, allowing for consistent transformations of validation and test datasets.

parameters:
· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset that needs to be transformed.
· preprocessor: An instance of a fitted preprocessor (such as from scikit-learn) that defines how the transformation should be applied.

Code Description: The function begins by transforming the input DataFrame `X` using the `transform` method of the provided `preprocessor`. This step applies any transformations that were learned during the fitting phase, such as scaling or encoding. The result is a NumPy array `X_array`, which contains the transformed data. To maintain consistency with the original DataFrame structure, this array is then converted back into a pandas DataFrame named `X_transformed`. The column names and index from the original DataFrame `X` are preserved in `X_transformed`.

Note: This function assumes that the preprocessor has already been fitted on another dataset (usually the training set) before being passed to `preprocess_transform`. It is crucial for maintaining consistency across different datasets, such as ensuring that categorical variables are encoded in the same way across training and test sets.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` contains two columns, 'feature1' and 'feature2', and the preprocessor scales these features, the output `X_transformed` will have the same column names but with scaled values. For instance:

Original DataFrame X:
| feature1 | feature2 |
|----------|----------|
| 10       | 5        |
| 20       | 15       |

Transformed DataFrame X_transformed (assuming min-max scaling):
| feature1 | feature2 |
|----------|----------|
| 0.0      | 0.0      |
| 1.0      | 1.0      |

This example illustrates how the original values are transformed, maintaining the same column structure but with modified data according to the preprocessor's specifications.
## FunctionDef preprocess_script
**preprocess_script**: This function applies preprocessing steps to the training, validation, and test datasets. It checks if preprocessed data files exist; if they do, it loads them directly. Otherwise, it preprocesses the raw data using a series of defined functions, fits a preprocessor on the training data, and then transforms all datasets consistently.

**parameters**:
· No explicit parameters are defined. The function operates on predefined file paths and does not accept any arguments directly.

**Code Description**: The function first checks if the preprocessed data files (X_train.pkl, X_valid.pkl, y_train.pkl, y_valid.pkl, X_test.pkl, others.pkl) exist in the "/kaggle/input/" directory. If these files are present, it loads them using pandas' `read_pickle` method and returns the loaded datasets along with any additional information stored in 'others.pkl'.

If the preprocessed data files do not exist, the function calls `prepreprocess()` to load and preprocess the raw training and test datasets from CSV files. This preprocessing includes dropping unnecessary columns, feature engineering for date-time features, encoding categorical variables, selecting relevant features, and splitting the training dataset into training and validation sets.

After obtaining the preprocessed data, the function fits a preprocessor on the training data using `preprocess_fit()`. The preprocessor is designed to handle missing values by imputing them with the mean of each numerical feature. Once fitted, this preprocessor is used to transform the training, validation, and test datasets consistently through `preprocess_transform()`.

The transformations ensure that all datasets are processed in a uniform manner, which is crucial for maintaining consistency during model training and evaluation.

**Note**: This function is typically called at the beginning of a machine learning pipeline to prepare the datasets for further processing, feature scaling, and modeling. It ensures that the data is clean, relevant features are extracted, and all datasets are transformed consistently according to the statistics derived from the training set.

**Output Example**: The function returns six values:
- X_train: A DataFrame containing the preprocessed training features (e.g., shape=(150000, 9))
- X_valid: A DataFrame containing the preprocessed validation features (e.g., shape=(37500, 9))
- y_train: A Series containing the training labels (e.g., shape=(150000,))
- y_valid: A Series containing the validation labels (e.g., shape=(37500,))
- X_test: A DataFrame containing the preprocessed test features for submission (e.g., shape=(88426, 9))
- category_encoder: The fitted LabelEncoder object used to encode the 'Category' column
- test_ids: A Series containing the IDs of the test samples for submission purposes (e.g., shape=(88426,))
