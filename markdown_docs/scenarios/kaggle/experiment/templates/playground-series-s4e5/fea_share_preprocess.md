## FunctionDef prepreprocess
**prepreprocess**: This function loads a dataset from a CSV file, performs initial preprocessing by removing unnecessary columns, splits the data into features (X) and target variable (y), and then further divides the dataset into training and validation sets.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters. It operates on a predefined path to load the dataset.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function starts by reading a CSV file located at "/kaggle/input/train.csv" using pandas' `read_csv` method, storing the data in a DataFrame named `data_df`. The 'id' column is then removed from this DataFrame as it is not needed for training or validation purposes. Following this, the dataset is split into features (`X`) and target variable (`y`). Here, all columns except "FloodProbability" are considered as features, while "FloodProbability" itself is treated as the target variable.

The `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn's model_selection module is then used to divide the dataset into training and validation sets. The split ratio is set at 90% for training (`X_train`, `y_train`) and 10% for validation (`X_valid`, `y_valid`). A random state of 42 ensures reproducibility of the split.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used as an initial step in a machine learning pipeline where data needs to be prepared before feeding it into a model. It assumes that the dataset is available at the specified path and that the necessary libraries (pandas and scikit-learn) are imported.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The function returns four pandas DataFrames:
- `X_train`: A DataFrame containing 90% of the original features for training purposes.
- `X_valid`: A DataFrame containing 10% of the original features for validation purposes.
- `y_train`: A Series containing 90% of the target variable values corresponding to the training set.
- `y_valid`: A Series containing 10% of the target variable values corresponding to the validation set.

These outputs can be used directly in subsequent steps such as model training and evaluation.
## FunctionDef preprocess_fit(X_train)
**preprocess_fit**: This function prepares a preprocessing pipeline specifically for numerical columns in a given training dataset by fitting it to the data. It identifies numerical columns, applies mean imputation where necessary, and returns both the fitted preprocessor and the list of numerical column names.

parameters:
· X_train: A pandas DataFrame containing the training data which will be used to fit the preprocessing pipeline.

Code Description: The function starts by identifying all columns in the input DataFrame `X_train` that have a data type of either "int64" or "float64", categorizing them as numerical. It then creates a numerical transformer using scikit-learn's Pipeline, which includes a SimpleImputer configured to fill missing values with the mean of each column. A ColumnTransformer is instantiated next, incorporating this numerical transformer specifically for the identified numerical columns. The preprocessor is fitted to `X_train`, learning the necessary statistics (like mean values) from the training data. Finally, the function returns both the fitted preprocessor and the list of numerical column names.

Note: This function is typically used in a preprocessing step before model training, ensuring that all numerical features are appropriately handled for machine learning algorithms that require complete datasets without missing values.

Output Example: Assuming `X_train` has columns 'age', 'height', and 'weight' with data types "int64", the output could be:
- preprocessor: A fitted ColumnTransformer object ready to transform new data using learned mean imputation.
- numerical_cols: ['age', 'height', 'weight'] indicating which columns were processed.
## FunctionDef preprocess_transform(X, preprocessor, numerical_cols)
**preprocess_transform**: This function applies a preprocessor to transform numerical features of a DataFrame and returns the transformed data as a new DataFrame.

parameters:
· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset that needs to be transformed.
· preprocessor: An object (likely from sklearn or similar library) that has been fitted with the training data and can perform transformations such as scaling, encoding, etc.
· numerical_cols: A list of column names in the DataFrame X that are considered numerical and should be included in the output DataFrame.

Code Description: The function preprocess_transform takes a DataFrame X and applies a transformation using the provided preprocessor object. This is typically used to apply the same preprocessing steps (like scaling or encoding) to both training and validation/test datasets as were applied during the fitting phase on the training data. After transforming, the resulting array is converted back into a pandas DataFrame with the original index from X and column names specified by numerical_cols.

Note: It's important that the preprocessor has already been fitted using the appropriate fit method before being passed to preprocess_transform. The columns in numerical_cols should match those used during the fitting phase of the preprocessor to ensure consistency.

Output Example: If X is a DataFrame with numerical features ['age', 'income'], and preprocessor scales these features, the output would be a DataFrame with scaled values for 'age' and 'income', maintaining the same index as X. For instance:

    age       income
0   1.234     -0.567
1   0.987      0.345
2  -0.123     -1.234

This output DataFrame can then be used for further analysis, model training, or evaluation in a machine learning pipeline.
## FunctionDef preprocess_script
**preprocess_script**: This function handles data preprocessing for a machine learning experiment by loading datasets from predefined paths or generating them if they do not exist. It applies preprocessing steps to training, validation, and test datasets, ensuring that numerical features are appropriately handled.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters. It operates on predefined file paths to load or generate the dataset.

Code Description: The function first checks if a set of preprocessed pickle files exists at specific paths within the "/kaggle/input/" directory. If these files exist, it loads them into respective variables (X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid, X_test, and others) using pandas' `read_pickle` method. These datasets are then returned directly.

If the required pickle files do not exist, the function calls another function named `prepreprocess`, which loads a dataset from a CSV file, performs initial preprocessing by removing unnecessary columns, splits the data into features (X) and target variable (y), and further divides it into training and validation sets. The split datasets are stored in X_train, X_valid, y_train, and y_valid.

Next, the function prepares a preprocessing pipeline for numerical columns using `preprocess_fit`, which identifies numerical columns, applies mean imputation where necessary, and returns both the fitted preprocessor and the list of numerical column names. This preprocessor is then used to transform the training and validation datasets with `preprocess_transform`.

For the test dataset, the function reads a submission CSV file located at "/kaggle/input/test.csv", removes an 'id' column, and applies the same preprocessing steps as those applied to the training and validation datasets.

Note: This function is typically used as part of a machine learning pipeline where data needs to be prepared before feeding it into a model. It assumes that the dataset is available at the specified paths or can be generated by `prepreprocess`. The necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn) should be imported for this function to work correctly.

Output Example: Assuming the datasets are loaded from pickle files or generated and preprocessed as described, the function returns six outputs:
- X_train: A DataFrame containing preprocessed features for training purposes.
- X_valid: A DataFrame containing preprocessed features for validation purposes.
- y_train: A Series containing target variable values corresponding to the training set.
- y_valid: A Series containing target variable values corresponding to the validation set.
- X_test: A DataFrame containing preprocessed features for testing or submission purposes.
- ids: A Series containing the 'id' column from the original test dataset, which can be used later for creating a submission file.

These outputs are ready to be used in subsequent steps such as model training and evaluation.
