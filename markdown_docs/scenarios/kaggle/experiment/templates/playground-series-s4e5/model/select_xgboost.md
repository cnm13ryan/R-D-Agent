## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns, the function flattens these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over the values of `X.columns`, converting each tuple to a string and joining its elements with underscores. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the function returns the modified DataFrame.

Note: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic by handling multi-level columns. Developers can extend this function to include actual feature selection algorithms as needed.

Output Example: Given a DataFrame with multi-level column names such as `pd.DataFrame({('a', 'b'): [1, 2], ('c', 'd'): [3, 4]})`, the function would return a DataFrame with flattened column names like `pd.DataFrame({'a_b': [1, 2], 'c_d': [3, 4]})`. If the input DataFrame already has single-level columns, it will be returned unchanged.
