## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset whose features need to be selected or processed. The DataFrame may have either single-level or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all columns are relevant features. If the DataFrame has multiple levels of column names (a MultiIndex), the function flattens these into a single level by joining each tuple of column labels with an underscore `_`. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over the values of `X.columns`, converting each multi-level column name into a string and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The modified column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`, and the updated DataFrame is returned.

Note: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a foundation for future feature selection logic. Additionally, handling multi-level column names ensures compatibility with datasets that may have been pre-processed in ways that introduce such structures.

Output Example: Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns like so:

```
         A            B
       C  D        E  F
0      1  2        3  4
1      5  6        7  8
```

The function would return a DataFrame with flattened column names:

```
   A_C  A_D  B_E  B_F
0    1    2    3    4
1    5    6    7    8
```
