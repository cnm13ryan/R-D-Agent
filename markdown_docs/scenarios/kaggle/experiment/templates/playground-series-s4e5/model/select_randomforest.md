## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's column index is one, indicating that all columns already have simple names. If this condition is met, it returns the DataFrame `X` as is without any modifications. Otherwise, it proceeds to flatten the multi-level column names into single-level names. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column level values into a single string separated by underscores. The resulting list of new column names replaces the existing multi-level column index in the DataFrame. Finally, the function returns this modified DataFrame with flattened column names.

Note: While the current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for future enhancements where specific feature selection logic can be integrated. The handling of multi-level columns is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that have complex structures, such as those resulting from operations like pivoting or merging.

Output Example: Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level column names like `pd.DataFrame({('a', 'b'): [1, 2], ('c', 'd'): [3, 4]})`, the function would return a DataFrame with flattened column names as follows:

```
   a_b  c_d
0    1    3
1    2    4
```
