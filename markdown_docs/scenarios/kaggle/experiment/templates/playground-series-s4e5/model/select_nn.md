## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame. It currently assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns (hierarchical column structure), the function flattens these columns into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore and converting them to strings. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the modified DataFrame is returned.

Note: While this function currently does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for handling multi-level columns, which can be useful in preprocessing steps before more sophisticated feature selection techniques are applied. Developers may extend this function to include specific feature selection logic as needed.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns like `('feature1', 'subfeatureA')`, `('feature2', 'subfeatureB')`, the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names such as `'feature1_subfeatureA'`, `'feature2_subfeatureB'`. Assuming all features are relevant, no other changes would be made to the data itself.
