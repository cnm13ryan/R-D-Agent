## FunctionDef compute_r2(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_r2**: This function calculates the R² (coefficient of determination) score, a statistical measure used to evaluate the performance of regression models. It quantifies how much of the variability in the dependent variable is predictable from the independent variables.

**parameters**:
· y_true: An array-like object representing the true values or actual outcomes.
· y_pred: An array-like object containing the predicted values generated by a regression model.

**Code Description**: The function `compute_r2` takes two primary inputs, `y_true` and `y_pred`, which are expected to be of compatible shapes. It computes the R² score using the `r2_score` function from an external library, likely scikit-learn in this context. The R² score ranges from negative infinity to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates that the model's predictions are very close to the true values, and a value of 0 means the model does not explain any variability of the response data around its mean.

**Note**: It is crucial that `y_true` and `y_pred` have the same length and represent corresponding values. The function assumes that the `r2_score` function is already imported from an appropriate library, typically scikit-learn's metrics module (`from sklearn.metrics import r2_score`). A high R² value does not necessarily mean a good model; it is essential to consider other factors such as overfitting and the context of the problem.

**Output Example**: If `y_true` is [3, -0.5, 2, 7] and `y_pred` is [2.5, 0.0, 2, 8], the function might return an R² score close to 0.9167, indicating that approximately 91.67% of the variance in `y_true` can be explained by the model's predictions in `y_pred`.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path. It utilizes the `importlib` library to create a module specification based on the given name and path, then loads and executes the module.

parameters:
· module_name: A string representing the name of the module you wish to import. This is not necessarily the filename but can be any valid Python identifier.
· module_path: A string representing the file system path to the Python file (.py) that contains the module code.

Code Description: The function begins by creating a module specification using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`. This specification includes all necessary information about the module, such as its location and name. Next, it creates an empty new module object with `importlib.util.module_from_spec`, which is then populated with the contents of the file specified in `module_path` through `spec.loader.exec_module(module)`. Finally, the fully loaded module is returned.

Note: This function is particularly useful when you need to import modules dynamically at runtime without knowing their names or locations beforehand. It allows for flexible and modular code design where modules can be added or changed independently of the main application logic.

Output Example: If `module_name` is 'my_module' and `module_path` points to a file containing a function named `greet`, calling `import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')` would return a module object. You could then access the `greet` function via `returned_module.greet()`.
