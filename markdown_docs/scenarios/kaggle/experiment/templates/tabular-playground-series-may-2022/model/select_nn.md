## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to process a pandas DataFrame by selecting relevant features. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic for handling multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset with potential multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If so, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. If the DataFrame has multiple levels in its column names (a MultiIndex), the function flattens these into a single-level index. This is achieved by joining each tuple of multi-level column names into a single string, with components separated by underscores. The resulting strings are then used to rename the columns of the DataFrame.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where datasets have complex column structures that need simplification before further processing or modeling. While the function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic if needed.

Output Example: Given a DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns such as:

```
         A        B
       1 2      3 4
0    10 20    30 40
1    50 60    70 80
```

The function would return a DataFrame with flattened column names:

```
   A_1  A_2  B_3  B_4
0   10   20   30   40
1   50   60   70   80
```
