## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame. It currently assumes that all features in the input DataFrame are relevant, but it includes logic for handling multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is 1. If true, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names (nlevels > 1), the function flattens these column names into a single level by joining each tuple of column labels with an underscore ('_'). This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over the values of X.columns, converting each tuple to a string and joining its elements. The modified DataFrame with flattened column names is then returned.

Note: Although the function currently does not perform any feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for future enhancements where specific criteria could be applied to select only certain features. Additionally, handling multi-level columns ensures compatibility with datasets that may have been pre-processed in ways that result in such structures.

Output Example: Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level column names like `pd.DataFrame({('a', 'b'): [1, 2], ('c', 'd'): [3, 4]})`, the function would return a DataFrame with columns renamed to `'a_b'` and `'c_d'`. The output would look like this:

```
   a_b  c_d
0    1    3
1    2    4
```
