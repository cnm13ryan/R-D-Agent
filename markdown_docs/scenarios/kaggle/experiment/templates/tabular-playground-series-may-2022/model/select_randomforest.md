## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected. The function expects this input to potentially have multi-level columns that need to be flattened.

Code Description: The `select` function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function simply returns the original DataFrame as all features are considered relevant. However, if the DataFrame has multiple levels of columns (a MultiIndex), the function proceeds to flatten these multi-level columns into single-level columns. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column labels into a single string separated by underscores (`_`). The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the concatenated strings, ensuring clean column names. After processing, the modified DataFrame with flattened column names is returned.

Note: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic and handles multi-level columns effectively by flattening them into single-level columns.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns such as `pd.DataFrame({('a', 'b'): [1, 2], ('c', 'd'): [3, 4]})`, the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names like `pd.DataFrame({'a_b': [1, 2], 'c_d': [3, 4]})`. If all columns are already single-level, the output will be identical to the input.
