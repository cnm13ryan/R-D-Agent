## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. It currently assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using the attribute `nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all columns are relevant features. However, if `X` contains multi-level column names, the function proceeds to flatten these into a single level. This is achieved by iterating over each column name (which can be a tuple for multi-level indices), converting each element of the tuple to a string, joining them with underscores, and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The resulting list of flattened column names is then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the function returns the modified DataFrame.

Note: While this function currently does not perform actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for handling multi-level column names, which can be useful in datasets with complex structures. Developers can extend this function by adding logic to filter or select specific features based on criteria such as statistical significance, correlation with the target variable, or domain knowledge.

Output Example: If `X` is a DataFrame with multi-level columns like `pd.DataFrame({('a', 'b'): [1, 2], ('c', 'd'): [3, 4]})`, the function will return a DataFrame with single-level column names `['a_b', 'c_d']` and the same data. If `X` already has single-level columns, it will be returned unchanged.
