## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes that all features in the DataFrame are relevant. However, it includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is 1. If true, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names (more than one level), it flattens these columns into single-level columns. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore and converting them to strings. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to the DataFrame's columns.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where feature selection logic might be added in future iterations. Currently, this function serves as a placeholder that ensures all features are considered relevant and handles multi-level column names appropriately by flattening them.

Output Example: Mock up of the code's return value:
Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns like:

| ('feature', 'A') | ('feature', 'B') |
|------------------|------------------|
| 1                | 2                |
| 3                | 4                |

The function will output a DataFrame with flattened column names:

| feature_A | feature_B |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 2         |
| 3         | 4         |
