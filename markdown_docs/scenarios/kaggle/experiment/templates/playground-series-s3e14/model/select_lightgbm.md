## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to process a pandas DataFrame by selecting relevant features. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset whose features need to be selected or processed.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns (hierarchical column structure), the function flattens these columns into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column levels into a single string separated by underscores. The modified DataFrame with flattened column names is then returned.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where data preprocessing involves handling datasets with complex, hierarchical column structures that need to be simplified for modeling purposes. While the function currently does not perform actual feature selection (removing irrelevant features), it provides a foundation for such operations and ensures compatibility with models that require single-level column names.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns like this:

| ('feature', 'A') | ('feature', 'B') |
|------------------|------------------|
| 1                | 2                |
| 3                | 4                |

The function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names:

| feature_A | feature_B |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 2         |
| 3         | 4         |
