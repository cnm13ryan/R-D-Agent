## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to process a pandas DataFrame by selecting relevant features. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset whose features need to be selected or processed.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant for further processing. However, if the DataFrame contains multi-level columns (hierarchical column structure), the function flattens these columns into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column labels into a single string, using an underscore to separate levels. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the modified DataFrame with potentially flattened column names is returned.

**Note**: While this function currently does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for handling multi-level columns which might be necessary in more complex data preprocessing pipelines. Developers can extend this function to include actual feature selection logic as needed.

**Output Example**: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns such as `pd.DataFrame({('a', 'b'): [1, 2], ('c', 'd'): [3, 4]})`, the output will be a DataFrame with single-level column names like `pd.DataFrame({'a_b': [1, 2], 'c_d': [3, 4]})`. If the input DataFrame already has single-level columns, it will be returned unchanged.
