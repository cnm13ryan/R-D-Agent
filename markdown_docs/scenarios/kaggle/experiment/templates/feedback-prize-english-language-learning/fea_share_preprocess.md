## FunctionDef preprocess_script
**preprocess_script**: This method applies preprocessing steps to the training, validation, and test datasets specifically for a Kaggle competition related to English language learning feedback scoring.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The function does not take any direct input arguments. It relies on predefined file paths within the "/kaggle/input/" directory to load data.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function first checks if preprocessed data files (X_train.pkl, X_valid.pkl, y_train.pkl, y_valid.pkl, X_test.pkl, others.pkl) exist in the specified path. If these files are found, it loads them using pandas' read_pickle method and returns the datasets directly.

If the preprocessed files do not exist, the function proceeds to load raw CSV data from "train.csv" and "test.csv". It then applies a cleaning process to the 'full_text' column of both datasets. The cleaning involves stripping whitespace, removing newline characters, and converting all text to lowercase using a helper function named `data_cleaner`.

The target variables (cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, conventions) are extracted from the training dataset into a separate DataFrame called `y_train`. Meanwhile, the cleaned 'full_text' data is separated into `X_train` and `X_test` for training and testing purposes.

Subsequently, the function splits the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`) into training and validation sets using an 80-20 split ratio. This is achieved through the use of `train_test_split` with a fixed random state (42) to ensure reproducibility of results.

Finally, the function returns the preprocessed datasets: `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, `y_valid`, and `X_test`.

Note: Usage points.
This function is designed to be called at the beginning of a machine learning pipeline where data preprocessing is necessary. It handles both loading preprocessed data if available or performing initial cleaning and splitting operations on raw data.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The output will be five pandas DataFrames:
- `X_train`: Contains the cleaned training text data.
- `X_valid`: Contains the cleaned validation text data (20% of the original training set).
- `y_train`: Contains the target scores for the training set.
- `y_valid`: Contains the target scores for the validation set (20% of the original training set).
- `X_test`: Contains the cleaned test text data.

Each DataFrame will have a shape corresponding to its purpose, with `X_train` and `X_valid` having one column ('full_text') and `y_train` and `y_valid` having six columns (one for each target score). The exact number of rows in `X_train`, `X_valid`, and `y_train`, `y_valid` will depend on the size of the original dataset, with `X_valid` and `y_valid` containing approximately 20% of the data. `X_test` will have a shape corresponding to the number of samples in the test set.
### FunctionDef data_cleaner(text)
**data_cleaner**: This function is designed to preprocess text data by performing a series of cleaning operations aimed at standardizing the format and reducing noise. It takes a string input, applies several transformations, and returns the cleaned string.

parameters:
· text: A string representing the raw text that needs to be cleaned.

Code Description: The function begins by removing any leading or trailing whitespace from the input text using the `strip()` method. This step ensures that there are no unnecessary spaces at the beginning or end of the text, which can affect subsequent processing steps. Following this, it uses a regular expression substitution with `re.sub(r"\n", "", text)` to eliminate all newline characters within the string. Newlines can disrupt the flow of text in certain analyses and visualizations, so their removal is often desirable. Lastly, the function converts the entire string to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This standardization step is crucial for ensuring that text processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, or lemmatization are not affected by case differences.

Note: Usage points include preparing text data for natural language processing (NLP) tasks where uniformity in text format is essential. By stripping whitespace, removing newlines, and normalizing the case of letters, this function helps to ensure that the text data is consistent and ready for further analysis or machine learning models.

Output Example: If the input string were "  Hello\nWorld!  ", the output would be "helloworld!". Notice how the leading spaces, trailing spaces, and newline character have been removed, and all letters are in lowercase.
