## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame. It is intended to be used within fit and predict functions, potentially as part of a preprocessing pipeline for machine learning models.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset with potential multi-level column names that need processing or feature selection.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has single-level column names. If it does, the function assumes all features are relevant and returns the DataFrame as is. However, if the DataFrame contains multi-level columns (hierarchical column structure), the function flattens these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore. This transformation simplifies the column names for easier handling in subsequent operations such as model training.

Note: The current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection based on relevance or importance; it merely processes the DataFrame to ensure that all column names are flat and suitable for use in machine learning models. Developers can extend this function by adding logic to select only relevant features based on domain knowledge, statistical tests, or model-based approaches.

Output Example: Given a DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns like:

| ('feature', '1') | ('feature', '2') |
|------------------|------------------|
| 0.5              | 0.3              |
| 0.7              | 0.8              |

The function will return:

| feature_1 | feature_2 |
|-----------|-----------|
| 0.5       | 0.3       |
| 0.7       | 0.8       |
