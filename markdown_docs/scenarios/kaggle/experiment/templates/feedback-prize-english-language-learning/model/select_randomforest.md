## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to process a pandas DataFrame by selecting relevant features. It assumes all features are relevant initially but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected or processed.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns are relevant for further processing. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names (hierarchical), the function flattens these into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over each column name in `X.columns.values`, converting each tuple to a string and stripping any extra whitespace. The modified DataFrame, now with flattened column names, is then returned.

**Note**: Usage points include preprocessing datasets before fitting models or making predictions, especially when dealing with datasets that have complex, multi-level column structures. This function ensures compatibility by simplifying the column structure to a single level, which can be crucial for many machine learning algorithms that do not support hierarchical columns directly.

**Output Example**: Mock up of the code's return value.
Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns like:
```
         Feature1            Feature2
             A    B              C
0          0.5  0.3           0.8
1          0.6  0.4           0.9
```
The function would return a DataFrame with flattened column names:
```
   Feature1_A  Feature1_B  Feature2_C
0         0.5         0.3         0.8
1         0.6         0.4         0.9
```
