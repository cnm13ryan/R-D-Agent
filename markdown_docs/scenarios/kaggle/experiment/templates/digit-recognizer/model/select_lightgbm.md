## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame. It is intended to be used within fit and predict functions, although currently, it assumes all features are relevant. The function also handles multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If this condition is true, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns are relevant. If there are multiple levels in the column names, the function proceeds to flatten these multi-level columns into single-level columns. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The modified DataFrame with flattened column names is then returned.

Note: Currently, the function does not perform any actual feature selection; it merely handles multi-level column names. Developers can expand this function to include more sophisticated feature selection logic if needed.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has a multi-level column structure like:

| ('level1', 'a') | ('level2', 'b') |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1               | 2               |
| 3               | 4               |

The function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names:

| level1_a | level2_b |
|----------|----------|
| 1        | 2        |
| 3        | 4        |
