## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame intended for use in machine learning model fitting and prediction processes, particularly within the context of the digit recognizer experiment.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset with potential multi-level columns that need processing or feature selection. The assumption here is that all features are initially considered relevant, but the function also handles cases where column names are multi-level by flattening them into a single level.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame X has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If this condition is true, it implies that no feature selection or renaming is necessary at this stage, and the original DataFrame is returned as is. However, if the columns are multi-level (indicating hierarchical data), the function proceeds to flatten these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This transformation ensures uniformity in column naming, which can be crucial for subsequent operations that expect flat column structures.

**Note**: The current implementation assumes all features are relevant and focuses on handling multi-level column names. Developers may extend this function to include actual feature selection logic based on domain knowledge or statistical tests if needed.

**Output Example**: Given a DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns such as `pd.DataFrame({('level1', 'a'): [1, 2], ('level2', 'b'): [3, 4]})`, the function would return a DataFrame with flattened column names: `pd.DataFrame({'level1_a': [1, 2], 'level2_b': [3, 4]})`. If `X` already has single-level columns, it will be returned unchanged.
