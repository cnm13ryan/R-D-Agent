## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single-level or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all columns are relevant features. If `X` contains multi-level column names, the function flattens these into single-level names. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column levels into a single string with underscores separating the original level values. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the modified DataFrame `X` is returned.

Note: While this function currently does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for future enhancements where specific feature selection logic can be implemented. Additionally, handling multi-level columns ensures compatibility with datasets that may have complex indexing structures.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level column names like `[('level1', 'a'), ('level2', 'b')]`, the function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names such as `['level1_a', 'level2_b']`. If all columns are already single-level, the output will be identical to the input.
