## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given pandas DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes that all features in the DataFrame are relevant. However, the function can be expanded to include more sophisticated feature selection logic if needed.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the column index of `X` is 1. If true, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns (features) are relevant and no further processing is needed for feature selection. If the DataFrame has a MultiIndex for its columns (more than one level), the function flattens these multi-level columns into single-level column names by joining each tuple of column labels with an underscore ('_'). This process ensures that the resulting DataFrame has simple, flat column names which can be more convenient for subsequent operations such as model fitting and prediction.

Note: The current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection based on statistical or machine learning criteria. It merely handles the case where the input DataFrame might have MultiIndex columns by flattening them into a single level of column names. Developers are encouraged to modify this function to include their own logic for selecting relevant features if necessary.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has MultiIndex columns, such as:

| ('feature', 'type1') | ('feature', 'type2') |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| 0.5                  | 0.3                  |
| 0.7                  | 0.8                  |

The function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names:

| feature_type1 | feature_type2 |
|---------------|---------------|
| 0.5           | 0.3           |
| 0.7           | 0.8           |
