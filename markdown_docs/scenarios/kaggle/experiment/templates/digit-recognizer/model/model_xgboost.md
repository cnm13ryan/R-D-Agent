## FunctionDef fit(X_train, y_train, X_valid, y_valid)
**fit**: Define and train an XGBoost model using training and validation datasets. The function prepares data matrices, sets parameters for multi-class classification, and trains the model with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

parameters:
· X_train: A 2D array-like structure containing the features of the training dataset.
· y_train: An array-like structure containing the labels corresponding to the training dataset.
· X_valid: A 2D array-like structure containing the features of the validation dataset.
· y_valid: An array-like structure containing the labels corresponding to the validation dataset.

Code Description: The function begins by converting the input datasets into DMatrix objects, which are optimized data structures for XGBoost. These matrices include both feature data and labels. Next, a dictionary named `params` is defined, specifying various parameters for the model training process:
- "objective": Specifies that this is a multi-class classification problem with softmax output.
- "eval_metric": Sets the evaluation metric to mlogloss (multiclass log loss).
- "num_class": Indicates there are 10 classes in the dataset.
- "nthread": Uses all available CPU threads for parallel processing.
- "tree_method": Specifies the tree construction algorithm, using GPU-accelerated histogram-based method.
- "device": Instructs XGBoost to use CUDA-enabled GPUs.

The variable `num_round` determines the maximum number of boosting rounds. An evaluation list `evallist` is created to monitor performance on both training and validation datasets during training. The model is then trained using these parameters, data matrices, and evaluation list, with early stopping enabled after 10 rounds without improvement in the evaluation metric.

Note: Ensure that CUDA-enabled GPUs are available if specifying "tree_method": "gpu_hist" and "device": "cuda". Adjust `num_round` and other hyperparameters as needed for optimal performance on different datasets.

Output Example: The function returns a trained XGBoost model object, which can be used for making predictions or further analysis. For instance:
```
<booster handle=0x7f8b1c4a2d50>
```
## FunctionDef predict(model, X)
**predict**: This function takes a trained XGBoost model and input data to predict the class labels of the input data using the specified model.

parameters:
· model: A pre-trained XGBoost model object that will be used for making predictions.
· X: Input feature matrix, typically a 2D array-like structure (e.g., NumPy array or Pandas DataFrame) containing the features for which predictions are to be made.

Code Description: The function begins by converting the input data `X` into an `xgb.DMatrix`, which is a specialized data structure used by XGBoost for efficient computation. This conversion ensures that the input data format is compatible with the requirements of the XGBoost library. Following this, the function calls the `predict` method on the provided model object, passing in the `dtest` DMatrix as an argument. The predictions are then converted to integers using the `astype(int)` method before being returned. This conversion step is crucial for ensuring that the predicted class labels are represented as integer values, which is a common requirement for classification tasks.

Note: It is important that the input features in `X` match those used during the training of the model in terms of order and type to maintain feature selection consistency. The function assumes that the model has already been trained and is ready for inference.

Output Example: If the input data `X` consists of 5 samples, the output might look like this:
[2, 7, 1, 0, 4]
Each integer in the list represents the predicted class label for each sample in the input data.
