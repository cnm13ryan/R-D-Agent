## FunctionDef compute_metrics_for_classification(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_metrics_for_classification**: This function calculates the accuracy of a classification model by comparing true labels against predicted labels.
parameters:
路 y_true: An array-like structure containing the actual class labels for the samples.
路 y_pred: An array-like structure containing the predicted class labels from the model.

Code Description: The function `compute_metrics_for_classification` is designed to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It takes two primary inputs, `y_true` and `y_pred`, which represent the true labels and the predicted labels respectively. The core functionality of this function relies on the `accuracy_score` method from an external library (presumably scikit-learn), which computes the accuracy by comparing these two sets of labels. Accuracy is a common metric used in classification tasks, representing the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where binary or multi-class classification models need to be evaluated based on their predictive performance against known true labels. This function assumes that both `y_true` and `y_pred` are aligned and have the same length, as they represent corresponding samples from a dataset.

Output Example: If `y_true = [0, 1, 2, 2]` and `y_pred = [0, 2, 1, 2]`, the function would return an accuracy score of 0.5, indicating that half of the predictions were correct.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path. It allows users to load modules at runtime based on their location on disk, which can be particularly useful for modular applications or plugins.

parameters:
路 module_name: A string representing the name of the module you wish to import. This is not necessarily tied to the filename but should be a valid Python identifier.
路 module_path: A string representing the file path to the Python module (.py file) that you want to import.

Code Description: The function utilizes the `importlib.util` module, which provides utilities for importing modules programmatically. It first creates a module specification using `spec_from_file_location`, specifying both the name and the location of the module. Then, it generates a new module based on this specification with `module_from_spec`. Finally, it executes the module in its own namespace using `exec_module` to ensure that all code within the module is properly initialized and executed. The function returns the imported module object, which can then be used like any other imported module.

Note: This function is particularly useful when you need to load modules dynamically based on user input or configuration files, or when working with plugins where the set of available modules might change over time. It's important that the file path provided points to a valid Python script (.py file) and that the script does not contain syntax errors.

Output Example: If there is a Python file located at '/path/to/my_module.py' containing a function `greet` defined as follows:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

Using `import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')` would allow you to call the `greet` function from the dynamically imported module like so:

```python
loaded_module = import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')
print(loaded_module.greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

This demonstrates how the function can be used to load and utilize functions or classes defined in external Python files.
