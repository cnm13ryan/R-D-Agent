## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame intended for use in fitting and predicting models, particularly within the context of the ventilator pressure prediction experiment.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset with potential multi-level column names that need to be processed or flattened if necessary.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function assumes all features are relevant and returns the DataFrame as is without any modifications. However, if the DataFrame contains multi-level columns (which can occur when performing operations that result in hierarchical indexing), the function proceeds to flatten these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This process ensures that the resulting DataFrame has simple, flat column names suitable for model training and prediction. The flattened column names are generated by converting each multi-level column name tuple into a string where individual levels are concatenated with underscores.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where data preprocessing is required before feeding it into machine learning models, especially when dealing with datasets that might have undergone transformations resulting in complex column structures. This function serves as a utility to simplify the DataFrame structure for compatibility with model fitting and prediction functions.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns like:
```
             sensor1        sensor2
               temp  pressure   temp  pressure
0                34       1.5     28       1.6
1                35       1.7     29       1.8
```

The function `select` would return:
```
   sensor1_temp  sensor1_pressure  sensor2_temp  sensor2_pressure
0            34             1.5            28             1.6
1            35             1.7            29             1.8
```
