## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic for handling multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all columns are relevant. If the DataFrame has multiple levels of column names, the function flattens these into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of multi-level column names into a single string with underscores separating the original levels. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`, and the modified DataFrame is returned.

Note: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic if needed. Additionally, handling multi-level columns ensures compatibility with datasets that may have been pre-processed or engineered in ways that result in such structures.

Output Example: Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level column names like `pd.DataFrame({('A', 'B'): [1, 2], ('C', 'D'): [3, 4]})`, the function would return a DataFrame with single-level columns named `'A_B'` and `'C_D'`. The output would look like this:

```
   A_B  C_D
0    1    3
1    2    4
```
