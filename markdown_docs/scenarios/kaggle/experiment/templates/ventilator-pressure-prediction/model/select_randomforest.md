## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. It assumes all features are relevant initially but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset with potential multi-level column names. The function processes this DataFrame to ensure it returns a DataFrame with only relevant features, where feature selection can be expanded in future implementations.

Code Description: The function starts by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of columns using `X.columns.nlevels`. If true, it directly returns `X`, assuming all columns are relevant. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names (more than one level), the function flattens these into single-level names by joining each tuple of column levels with an underscore `_`. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over each column name in `X.columns.values`, converting each tuple to a string and stripping any extra whitespace. The modified column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`, and the updated DataFrame is returned.

Note: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic by handling multi-level column names. Developers can expand upon this function to include actual feature selection techniques as needed.

Output Example: Given an input DataFrame with multi-level columns like `pd.DataFrame({('time', 's'): [1, 2], ('pressure', 'kPa'): [100, 200]})`, the function would return a DataFrame with flattened column names: `pd.DataFrame({'time_s': [1, 2], 'pressure_kPa': [100, 200]})`. If the input DataFrame already has single-level columns, it will be returned unchanged.
