## FunctionDef fit(X_train, y_train, X_valid, y_valid)
**fit**: Define and train a Random Forest model using training data, then evaluate its performance on validation data by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE).

parameters:
· X_train: A pandas DataFrame containing the features of the training dataset.
· y_train: A pandas Series representing the target variable for the training dataset.
· X_valid: A pandas DataFrame containing the features of the validation dataset.
· y_valid: A pandas Series representing the target variable for the validation dataset.

Code Description: The function initializes a Random Forest Regressor with 100 trees, setting a random state for reproducibility and using all available CPU cores to speed up computation. It then fits this model to the training data (X_train and y_train). After training, the model is used to make predictions on the validation dataset (X_valid), and these predictions are compared against the actual target values (y_valid) to compute the mean absolute error (MAE). The MAE provides a measure of how far off the predictions are from the true values, on average. This metric is printed out for evaluation purposes.

Note: It's important that X_train, y_train, X_valid, and y_valid are preprocessed consistently before being passed to this function. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if necessary, and scaling features if required by the model or desired for performance reasons.

Output Example: RandomForestRegressor object
The function returns a trained Random Forest Regressor model that can be used for making predictions on new data. For instance, after training, you could use `model.predict(new_data)` to predict the target variable for a new dataset `new_data`. The printed output might look like this:
Validation MAE of RandomForestRegressor: 0.5234
This indicates that, on average, the model's predictions are off by approximately 0.5234 units from the true values in the validation set.
## FunctionDef predict(model, X)
**predict**: This function takes a trained machine learning model and input data to make predictions while ensuring consistency in feature selection.

parameters:
· model: A pre-trained RandomForestRegressor model that has been fitted on the training dataset.
· X: Input features for which predictions are to be made, typically a NumPy array or pandas DataFrame with the same structure as the training data used to fit the model.

Code Description: The function predict is designed to generate predictions based on an input dataset using a pre-trained RandomForestRegressor model. It ensures that the feature selection process remains consistent between the training and prediction phases by requiring the input features (X) to match the format and order of features used during model training. The model's predict method is called with X as its argument, which returns the predicted values. These predictions are then reshaped into a 2-dimensional array with one column using the reshape(-1, 1) method, ensuring that the output format is compatible with further processing or evaluation steps.

Note: It is crucial that the input features (X) passed to this function have undergone the same preprocessing and feature selection transformations as those applied to the training data. Failure to do so can lead to inaccurate predictions due to discrepancies in feature representation between the training and prediction datasets.

Output Example: If the input X consists of 10 samples, the output will be a NumPy array with shape (10, 1), where each element represents the predicted pressure value for the corresponding sample. For instance:
[[23.45]
 [27.89]
 [22.67]
 [25.12]
 [24.99]
 [26.34]
 [21.01]
 [23.78]
 [24.56]
 [28.23]]
