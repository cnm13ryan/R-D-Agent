## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. It assumes that all features are initially considered relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset. The function expects this DataFrame to be preprocessed and ready for feature selection or model training.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `select` function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns are relevant. However, if the DataFrame contains multi-level column names (hierarchical), the function proceeds to flatten these names. This is achieved by iterating over each tuple in `X.columns.values`, joining the elements of each tuple into a single string separated by underscores, and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The resulting list of flattened column names is then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the modified DataFrame with flattened column names is returned.

Note: Usage points.
This function can be particularly useful in data preprocessing pipelines where feature selection might involve handling multi-level columns that need to be simplified for further processing or model training. It ensures that all features are considered relevant unless explicitly specified otherwise and provides a mechanism to handle complex column structures by flattening them into a more manageable format.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns like this:

| ('time', 'step') | ('pressure', 'value') |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| 1                | 2.5                   |
| 2                | 3.0                   |

The function would output a DataFrame with flattened column names:

| time_step | pressure_value |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1         | 2.5            |
| 2         | 3.0            |
