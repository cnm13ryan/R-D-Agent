## FunctionDef compute_metrics_for_classification(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_metrics_for_classification**: This function computes the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for a classification task. The MCC is a measure of the quality of binary classifications, providing information about the balance between precision and recall.

**parameters**:
路 y_true: A list or array-like structure containing the true labels.
路 y_pred: A list or array-like structure containing the predicted labels by the model.

**Code Description**: The function takes two main inputs, `y_true` and `y_pred`, which represent the actual and predicted classifications, respectively. It then calculates the Matthews Correlation Coefficient using the `matthews_corrcoef` function from a library such as scikit-learn. The MCC is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets because it considers true and false positives and negatives, providing a measure of the quality of binary classification that ranges between -1 (total disagreement) and +1 (perfect prediction).

**Note**: It's important to ensure that both `y_true` and `y_pred` are in the same format and contain the same number of elements. The function assumes that the inputs are appropriate for a binary classification problem.

**Output Example**: If `y_true = [0, 1, 0, 1]` and `y_pred = [0, 0, 1, 1]`, the function would return an MCC value of approximately -0.577, indicating a moderate level of disagreement between the true labels and predictions.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path, allowing for flexible module loading at runtime.

parameters:
路 module_name: A string representing the name of the module to be imported.
路 module_path: A string specifying the file system path to the Python file containing the module.

Code Description: The function utilizes the `importlib.util` module, which provides utilities for importing modules programmatically. It first creates a module specification using `spec_from_file_location`, where it takes the name of the module and its location (file path) as arguments. This specification contains all necessary information about how to load the module.

Next, `module_from_spec` is called with the previously created specification object to create a new module based on that spec. The module is not yet loaded at this point; it's just an uninitialized module object.

Finally, `exec_module` of the loader associated with the specification is invoked to execute the module in its own namespace and initialize it. This step effectively loads the module into memory, making its contents available for use.

The function then returns the fully initialized module object, which can be used like any other imported module in Python.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where modules need to be loaded dynamically based on user input or configuration files, or when working with plugins that are not known at development time. This function is particularly useful in environments where the structure of the application might change frequently or where additional functionality can be added through external scripts.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming there is a Python file located at '/path/to/my_module.py' with the following content:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello from my_module!")
```
Using `import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')` would return a module object that can be used as follows:
```python
loaded_module = import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')
loaded_module.greet()  # Output: Hello from my_module!
```
This demonstrates how the dynamically imported module's functions can be accessed and utilized.
