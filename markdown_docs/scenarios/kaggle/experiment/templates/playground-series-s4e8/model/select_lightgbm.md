## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset whose features need to be selected or processed. The DataFrame may have either single-level or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all columns are relevant features. If the DataFrame has multiple levels of column names (a MultiIndex), the function flattens these into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore `_`. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over the values of `X.columns`, converting each multi-level index to a string and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The modified column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`, and the updated DataFrame is returned.

Note: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic by handling MultiIndex columns appropriately. Developers can extend this function to include actual feature selection techniques as needed.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level column names like `[('level1', 'feature1'), ('level2', 'feature2')]`, the output will be a DataFrame with single-level column names `['level1_feature1', 'level2_feature2']`. If all columns are already at a single level, the output will simply mirror the input.
