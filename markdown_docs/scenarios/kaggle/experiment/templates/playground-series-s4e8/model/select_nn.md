## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame. It is intended to be used within fit and predict functions, potentially as part of a preprocessing step before model training or evaluation.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset. The columns may have multiple levels (hierarchical).

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame's column index has only one level using `X.columns.nlevels`. If this condition is true, it implies that all features are considered relevant at this stage, and the function returns the DataFrame as is without any modifications. 

If the DataFrame columns have multiple levels (hierarchical), the function proceeds to flatten these multi-level column names into single-level names by joining each tuple of column labels with an underscore ('_'). This transformation is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over `X.columns.values`, converting each tuple of column labels into a string where elements are joined by underscores. The resulting list of flattened column names is then assigned back to `X.columns`.

**Note**: Currently, the function assumes all features are relevant and does not implement any feature selection logic. This can be expanded in future iterations to include actual feature selection techniques.

**Output Example**: If the input DataFrame `X` has columns with multi-level indices like `[('feature1', 'subfeat1'), ('feature2', 'subfeat2')]`, the function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names: `['feature1_subfeat1', 'feature2_subfeat2']`. If all features are already in single-level format, the output will be identical to the input.
