## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame. It is intended to be used within fit and predict functions, potentially as part of a preprocessing step before model training or prediction.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If this condition is met, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns (features) are relevant for further processing. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names, the function flattens these into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This transformation simplifies the column names, making them easier to handle in subsequent steps of data processing or model training.

Note: The current implementation assumes all features are relevant. However, this function can be expanded to include more sophisticated feature selection logic if needed.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns like (('feature', 'type1'), ('feature', 'type2')), the output will have flattened column names such as 'feature_type1' and 'feature_type2'. For a single-level column DataFrame, the output will be identical to the input.
