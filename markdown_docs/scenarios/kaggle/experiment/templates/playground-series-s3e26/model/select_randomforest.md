## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The function expects this input to potentially have multi-level column names that may need to be flattened.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function `select` begins by checking if the number of levels in the columns of DataFrame `X` is 1, indicating that all columns are already at a single level. If true, it simply returns the original DataFrame without any modifications. However, if the DataFrame has multi-level column names (more than one level), the function proceeds to flatten these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over the values of `X.columns`, converting each tuple of column names into a string where elements are joined by underscores. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the function returns the modified DataFrame with single-level column names.

Note: Usage points.
This function is intended to be used in the context of feature selection within machine learning workflows, particularly when dealing with datasets that have multi-level column names. It can serve as a preprocessing step before fitting models or making predictions, ensuring that all features are represented in a consistent format. While currently it does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), the function is structured to allow for future expansion of its logic to include more sophisticated feature selection techniques.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Suppose `X` is a DataFrame with multi-level columns like this:
```
   A        B
0  1.2      3.4
1  5.6      7.8
```
Where `A` and `B` are tuples representing the column names, e.g., `('level_0', 'sub_level_0')`. After applying the function `select`, the DataFrame would be transformed to:
```
   A_sub_level_0  B_sub_level_0
0          1.2            3.4
1          5.6            7.8
```
Here, the multi-level column names have been flattened into single-level names by joining the levels with an underscore ('_').
