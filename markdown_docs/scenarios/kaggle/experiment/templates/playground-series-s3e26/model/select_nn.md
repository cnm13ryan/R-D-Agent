## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to process a pandas DataFrame by selecting relevant features. Currently, it assumes all features in the DataFrame are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated strings.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset whose features need to be processed or selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns are relevant. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names (hierarchical), the function flattens these into a single level by joining each tuple of column labels into a single string separated by underscores. This flattened list of column names replaces the original multi-level column names in the DataFrame.

Note: The current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection based on relevance or importance; it merely handles the case where the input DataFrame has multi-level columns, which can be common in datasets with complex structures. Developers should modify this function to include their specific feature selection logic if needed.

Output Example: Given a DataFrame `X` with multi-level column names such as `[('feature1', 'subfeat1'), ('feature2', 'subfeat2')]`, the function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names like `['feature1_subfeat1', 'feature2_subfeat2']`. If `X` already has single-level columns, it will be returned unchanged.
