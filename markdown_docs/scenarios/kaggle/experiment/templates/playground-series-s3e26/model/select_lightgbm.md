## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns are relevant features. If the DataFrame has multiple levels in its column names (a MultiIndex), the function flattens these multi-level names into single-level names by joining each tuple of column labels with an underscore `_` and converting them to strings. This flattened list of new column names is then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the modified DataFrame `X` is returned.

Note: The current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection based on statistical or model-based criteria. It merely handles multi-level column names by flattening them. Developers can expand this function to include more sophisticated feature selection logic as needed for their specific use cases.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has a MultiIndex with columns like `[('feature', 'A'), ('feature', 'B')]`, the output will be a DataFrame with single-level column names `['feature_A', 'feature_B']`. If the input DataFrame already has single-level column names, it will be returned unchanged.
