## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given pandas DataFrame. It currently assumes that all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns (features) are relevant for further processing. However, if the DataFrame has multi-level column names, the function proceeds to flatten these into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column levels into a single string separated by underscores. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`, and the modified DataFrame is returned.

Note: While this function currently does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for handling multi-level column names, which can be useful in datasets with complex structures. Developers can extend this function by adding logic to filter out irrelevant or redundant features based on specific criteria.

Output Example: Given a DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns like:

```
| ('feature', 'A') | ('feature', 'B') |
|------------------|------------------|
| 1                | 2                |
| 3                | 4                |
```

The function will return:

```
| feature_A | feature_B |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 2         |
| 3         | 4         |
```
