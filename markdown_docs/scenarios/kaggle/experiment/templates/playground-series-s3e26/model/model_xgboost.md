## FunctionDef fit(X_train, y_train, X_valid, y_valid)
**fit**: This function defines and trains an XGBoost model using training and validation datasets. It prepares the data into DMatrix format, sets up parameters for multi-class classification, and trains the model over a specified number of rounds.

parameters:
· X_train: A pandas DataFrame containing the features of the training dataset.
· y_train: A pandas DataFrame containing the labels of the training dataset.
· X_valid: A pandas DataFrame containing the features of the validation dataset.
· y_valid: A pandas DataFrame containing the labels of the validation dataset.

Code Description: The function begins by converting the input training and validation datasets into DMatrix objects, which are a specialized data structure used by XGBoost for efficient computation. It calculates the number of unique classes in the training labels to configure the model for multi-class classification. A set of parameters is defined, specifying the objective as "multi:softprob" (which outputs probabilities for each class), setting the number of classes, and configuring the use of GPU acceleration for faster training. The function then trains the XGBoost model using these parameters over a specified number of rounds, evaluating its performance on both the training and validation datasets.

Note: This function assumes that the input data is preprocessed and ready for training. It also requires that the XGBoost library (xgb) and NumPy are imported in the environment where this function is used. The GPU configuration ("tree_method": "gpu_hist", "device": "cuda") may require additional setup depending on the system's hardware capabilities.

Output Example: The function returns a trained XGBoost model object (`bst`), which can be used for making predictions on new data or further evaluation. This model object encapsulates all the learned parameters and configurations from the training process.
## FunctionDef predict(model, X)
**predict**: This function takes a trained XGBoost model and a dataset as input to predict probabilities of the target variable using the given features.

parameters:
· model: A pre-trained XGBoost model object that has been fitted on training data.
· X: A feature matrix (typically a pandas DataFrame or numpy array) containing the input features for which predictions are required.

Code Description: The function begins by converting the input feature matrix `X` into an `xgb.DMatrix`, which is a specialized data structure used by XGBoost to efficiently handle and process data. This conversion ensures that the data format is compatible with the internal operations of the XGBoost library, particularly for prediction tasks. After preparing the data in the required format, the function calls the `predict` method on the provided model object, passing the `dtest` (the DMatrix representation of input features) as an argument. This method computes and returns the predicted probabilities for each instance in the dataset. The returned predictions are stored in `y_pred_prob`, which is then returned by the function.

Note: It's crucial that the feature set provided in `X` matches the features used during the training phase of the model to ensure consistency and accurate predictions. Additionally, the output from this function represents probabilities; if class labels are needed instead, a threshold (commonly 0.5 for binary classification) can be applied to convert these probabilities into discrete classes.

Output Example: If `X` contains data for three samples, the output might look like [0.123, 0.876, 0.456], representing the predicted probabilities of the positive class for each sample.
