## FunctionDef prepreprocess
**prepreprocess**: This function loads training data from CSV and Parquet files, merges them based on specific keys, splits the merged dataset into features (X) and target variable (y), and then further divides these into training and validation sets.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly. It operates with predefined file paths for loading data.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by loading a primary training dataset from a CSV file located at "/kaggle/input/train.csv" using pandas' `read_csv` method, storing it in the variable `train_df`. Following this, two additional datasets are loaded from Parquet files: book data from "/kaggle/input/book_train.parquet" and trade data from "/kaggle/input/trade_train.parquet", both stored in `book_train` and `trade_train` respectively.

These datasets are then merged with the primary training dataset (`train_df`) using pandas' `merge` method. The merge is performed on two common columns, "stock_id" and "time_id". This step ensures that all relevant information from the book and trade data is combined with the initial training data based on these identifiers.

After merging, the function prepares the dataset for machine learning by separating it into features (X) and target variable (y). The feature set `X` includes all columns except the "target" column, while `y` consists solely of the "target" values. This separation is crucial as it defines what data will be used to train a model (`X`) and what the model aims to predict (`y`).

The function then splits the dataset into training and validation sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` method, with 20% of the data reserved for validation. The random state is set to 42 to ensure reproducibility of results.

Finally, the function prints out the column names of both the full feature set (`X`) and the training subset (`X_train`). This print statement can be useful for debugging or verifying that the dataset has been prepared as expected before proceeding with model training.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used at the beginning of a machine learning pipeline to prepare data for training. It assumes that the necessary input files are available in the specified paths and that pandas and scikit-learn libraries are imported. The output from this function, which includes training and validation datasets, can then be passed to other functions or models for further processing.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The function returns four DataFrames:
- `X_train`: A DataFrame containing 80% of the features used for training the model.
- `X_valid`: A DataFrame containing 20% of the features used for validating the model.
- `y_train`: A Series containing the target variable corresponding to `X_train`.
- `y_valid`: A Series containing the target variable corresponding to `X_valid`.

For example, if the original dataset had 1000 rows and 15 columns (including the "target" column), the output might look like this:
- `X_train` would have approximately 800 rows and 14 columns.
- `X_valid` would have approximately 200 rows and 14 columns.
- `y_train` would be a Series with approximately 800 entries.
- `y_valid` would be a Series with approximately 200 entries.
## FunctionDef preprocess_fit(X_train)
**preprocess_fit**: This function prepares a preprocessing pipeline for a given training dataset by identifying numerical and categorical columns, applying appropriate transformations, and fitting these transformations to the data.

parameters:
· X_train: A pandas DataFrame containing the training data which includes both numerical and categorical features.

Code Description: The function begins by segregating the columns of the input DataFrame `X_train` into two lists based on their data types. Columns with integer or float data types are classified as numerical, while those with object data types (typically strings) are considered categorical. 

For the categorical columns, a preprocessing pipeline is constructed using scikit-learn's `Pipeline`. This pipeline consists of two steps: first, missing values in these columns are imputed using the most frequent value encountered during training (`SimpleImputer(strategy="most_frequent")`). Second, the categorical data is transformed into numerical format using ordinal encoding (`OrdinalEncoder(handle_unknown="use_encoded_value", unknown_value=-1)`). The `handle_unknown` parameter ensures that any unseen categories in future datasets are encoded with a specific value (-1), preventing errors during prediction.

Similarly, for numerical columns, another pipeline is created. This pipeline includes only one step: imputing missing values using the mean of each column (`SimpleImputer(strategy="mean")`).

Both pipelines are then combined into a single `ColumnTransformer`, which applies the appropriate transformation to each type of data based on their respective lists of columns. The `fit` method is called on this transformer with `X_train` as its argument, allowing it to learn the necessary parameters for imputation and encoding from the training data.

Finally, the function returns three items: the fitted `ColumnTransformer`, a list of numerical column names, and a list of categorical column names. These outputs can be used later in the machine learning pipeline to preprocess new datasets consistently with the training data.

Note: It is crucial that the same preprocessing steps are applied to both training and test datasets to ensure consistency in feature representation across different stages of model development and deployment.

Output Example: 
(preprocessor, ['time_id', 'seconds_in_bucket'], ['stock_id'])
Here, `preprocessor` is a fitted `ColumnTransformer` object ready for use on new data. The lists represent the numerical and categorical column names identified from the training dataset `X_train`.
## FunctionDef preprocess_transform(X, preprocessor, numerical_cols, categorical_cols)
**preprocess_transform**: This function applies a preprocessor to transform input data and returns the transformed DataFrame with appropriate column names.

parameters:
· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset to be transformed.
· preprocessor: An instance of a preprocessor object (such as from sklearn's ColumnTransformer) that defines how the numerical and categorical columns should be transformed.
· numerical_cols: A list of strings representing the names of the numerical columns in the DataFrame.
· categorical_cols: A list of strings representing the names of the categorical columns in the DataFrame.

Code Description: The function preprocess_transform begins by applying the transform method of the provided preprocessor object to the input DataFrame X. This step applies any preprocessing steps defined in the preprocessor (such as scaling numerical features or encoding categorical ones) to the data. The result is a NumPy array containing the transformed data. 

Next, this NumPy array is converted back into a pandas DataFrame. During this conversion, the columns of the new DataFrame are set to be the concatenation of the numerical_cols and categorical_cols lists, ensuring that each column in the transformed DataFrame has an appropriate name corresponding to its original feature type. The index of the new DataFrame is also set to match the index of the input DataFrame X, preserving any row identifiers.

Finally, the function returns this newly constructed DataFrame containing the preprocessed data.

Note: It is important that the order and types of columns in the input DataFrame X match those expected by the preprocessor object. The lists numerical_cols and categorical_cols should accurately reflect the column names and their respective types in X to ensure correct transformation and labeling of the output DataFrame.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame X contains two numerical columns 'price' and 'volume', and one categorical column 'sector', and the preprocessor scales the numerical features and encodes the categorical feature, the returned DataFrame might look like this:

| price_scaled | volume_scaled | sector_encoded |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| 0.5          | -1.2          | 3              |
| 1.8          | 0.4           | 1              |
| -0.7         | 2.1           | 2              |

Here, 'price_scaled' and 'volume_scaled' represent the scaled numerical features, while 'sector_encoded' represents the encoded categorical feature. The actual values will depend on the specific preprocessor used and the data in X.
## FunctionDef preprocess_script
**preprocess_script**: This function handles data preprocessing for a machine learning experiment. It checks if preprocessed pickle files exist; if they do, it loads them directly. If not, it calls another function (`prepreprocess`) to preprocess the data from CSV and Parquet files. The function also prepares a submission DataFrame by adding missing columns and handling missing values.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly. It operates with predefined file paths for loading and saving data.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function starts by checking if the preprocessed pickle files (`X_train.pkl`, `X_valid.pkl`, `y_train.pkl`, `y_valid.pkl`, `X_test.pkl`, and `others.pkl`) exist in the "/kaggle/input/" directory. If these files are found, it loads them using pandas' `read_pickle` method into respective variables: `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, `y_valid`, `X_test`, and unpacks any additional data stored in `others`.

If the pickle files do not exist, the function calls `prepreprocess` to load and preprocess the raw training data from CSV and Parquet files. This involves merging datasets based on specific keys and splitting them into features (X) and target variable (y), followed by dividing these into training and validation sets.

After obtaining the training and validation datasets, the function reads a submission DataFrame from a CSV file located at "/kaggle/input/test.csv". It extracts the "row_id" column for later use and removes it from the DataFrame to align with the feature set structure.

The function then ensures that all columns present in `X_train` are also present in the submission DataFrame. If any columns are missing, they are added with a default value of 0 (or another appropriate value). This step is crucial for maintaining consistency between the training data and the submission data.

Next, the function handles missing values in the datasets by filling them with the mean of each column. This operation is performed on `X_train`, `X_valid`, and the submission DataFrame to ensure that all datasets are complete and ready for further processing or model training.

Finally, the function returns the preprocessed training and validation datasets (`X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, `y_valid`), the prepared submission DataFrame (`submission_df`), and the extracted "row_id" column (`ids`). These outputs can be used directly in subsequent steps of a machine learning pipeline for model training, evaluation, and submission.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used at the beginning of a machine learning pipeline to prepare data for training and submission. It assumes that the necessary input files are available in the specified paths and that pandas library is imported. The output from this function can then be passed to other functions or models for further processing.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The function returns six outputs:
- `X_train`: A DataFrame containing features used for training the model.
- `X_valid`: A DataFrame containing features used for validating the model.
- `y_train`: A Series containing the target variable corresponding to `X_train`.
- `y_valid`: A Series containing the target variable corresponding to `X_valid`.
- `submission_df`: A DataFrame prepared for submission, with all necessary columns and missing values handled.
- `ids`: A Series containing the "row_id" column extracted from the original submission file.

For example, if the original datasets had 1000 rows and 15 columns (including the "target" column), the output might look like this:
- `X_train` would have approximately 800 rows and 14 columns.
- `X_valid` would have approximately 200 rows and 14 columns.
- `y_train` would be a Series with approximately 800 entries.
- `y_valid` would be a Series with approximately 200 entries.
- `submission_df` would have the same number of columns as `X_test` (including any added columns) and all missing values filled.
- `ids` would be a Series containing the "row_id" values from the submission file.
