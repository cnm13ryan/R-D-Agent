## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function selects relevant features from a pandas DataFrame intended for use in model fitting and prediction processes. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset with potential multi-level columns that need to be processed before being used in machine learning models.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all features are relevant for modeling. However, if `X` contains multi-level columns (which can occur when performing operations like pivoting or merging that result in hierarchical column indices), the function flattens these column names into a single level by joining each tuple of column labels with an underscore ('_'). This transformation is necessary to ensure compatibility with many machine learning libraries that expect flat, non-hierarchical column structures. The flattened column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`, and the modified DataFrame is returned.

**Note**: Usage points include preprocessing datasets before feeding them into models like XGBoost where multi-level columns might cause issues. This function can be expanded with more sophisticated feature selection logic in future iterations, but for now, it serves as a basic utility to handle column name formatting.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns like:
```
            time_id  stock_id
feature_1   0.1      0.2
feature_2   0.3      0.4
```
The function would output a DataFrame with flattened column names:
```
time_id_stock_id  feature_1  feature_2
0.1               0.1        0.3
0.2               0.2        0.4
```
