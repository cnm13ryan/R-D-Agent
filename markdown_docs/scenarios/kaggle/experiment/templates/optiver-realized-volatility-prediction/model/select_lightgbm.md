## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function selects relevant features from a pandas DataFrame intended for use in model fitting and prediction processes. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset with potential multi-level columns that need to be processed before being used in machine learning models.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant for the model. However, if the DataFrame contains multi-level columns (which can happen when performing operations like pivoting or merging that result in hierarchical column indices), the function flattens these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This process involves iterating over the values of `X.columns`, converting each tuple to a string, and then stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The modified DataFrame is then returned.

Note: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic by handling multi-level columns. Developers can extend this function to include actual feature selection techniques based on domain knowledge or statistical methods.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns like [('time', 'open'), ('time', 'close')], the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names ['time_open', 'time_close']. If all columns are already single-level, the output is identical to the input.
