## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single-level or multi-level columns.

Code Description: The function starts by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns are relevant. If the DataFrame has multiple levels in its column names, the function flattens these multi-level names into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore (`_`). This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over `X.columns.values`, converting each tuple to a string and stripping any extra whitespace. The modified column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the function returns the DataFrame with the updated column structure.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where feature selection logic might be added in the future or when dealing with datasets that have complex multi-level column structures that need to be simplified for further processing.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has columns like `('time_id', 'feature_1')`, `('time_id', 'feature_2')`, the function will return a DataFrame with columns renamed to `'time_id_feature_1'`, `'time_id_feature_2'`. Assuming all features are relevant, no feature selection is performed beyond this renaming step.
