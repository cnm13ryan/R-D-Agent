## FunctionDef compute_rmspe(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_rmspe**: This function calculates the Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE), a common metric used to measure the accuracy of models in regression tasks, particularly when dealing with percentage errors.

parameters:
路 y_true: An array-like structure representing the true values or actual outcomes.
路 y_pred: An array-like structure representing the predicted values from a model.

Code Description: The function starts by computing the difference between each pair of true and predicted values. It then divides these differences by the true values to obtain the percentage error for each prediction. These percentage errors are squared to ensure they are all positive, which prevents negative errors from canceling out positive ones. The mean of these squared percentage errors is calculated next, providing an average measure of how much the predictions deviate from the actual outcomes in terms of percentage. Finally, the square root of this mean value is taken to return the Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE), which provides a more interpretable error metric by bringing it back to the original units of measurement.

Note: It's important that y_true does not contain zero values as division by zero would result in an undefined or infinite percentage error, leading to incorrect RMSPE calculations. Additionally, both y_true and y_pred should be of the same length and structure for accurate comparison.

Output Example: If y_true = [100, 200, 300] and y_pred = [95, 210, 280], then compute_rmspe(y_true, y_pred) would return approximately 0.0764 or 7.64%. This indicates that the predictions deviate from the actual values by an average of about 7.64% in terms of percentage error.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path. It allows for the loading of modules at runtime, which can be particularly useful when dealing with plugins or extensions that are not known until execution time.

parameters:
路 module_name: A string representing the name you want to assign to the imported module within your program.
路 module_path: A string specifying the absolute or relative file path to the Python file containing the module to be imported.

Code Description: The function utilizes the `importlib` library, which provides a comprehensive interface for importing modules. It starts by creating a specification (spec) for the module using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location()`, where it takes the desired name of the module and its path as arguments. This specification contains all necessary information about the module that needs to be loaded.

Next, `importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)` is called with the previously created spec object to create a new module based on this specification. The module is not yet populated with any code at this point; it's just an empty shell with the specified name.

The function then uses `spec.loader.exec_module(module)` to execute the module in its own namespace, effectively loading all of its contents into the module object created earlier. This step compiles and executes the source file located at `module_path`, making all functions, classes, and variables defined there available through the `module` object.

Finally, the function returns the fully loaded module object, which can now be used like any other imported module in Python.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where modules need to be dynamically loaded based on user input or configuration files. This is common in applications that support plugins or extensions, as it allows for flexibility and modularity without requiring all possible modules to be known at development time.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Suppose there is a Python file located at '/path/to/my_module.py' containing:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello from my module!")
```
Using `import_module_from_path('my_dynamic_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')` would result in an object that can be used as follows:
```python
loaded_module = import_module_from_path('my_dynamic_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')
loaded_module.greet()  # Outputs: Hello from my module!
```
This demonstrates how the function allows for dynamic importing and usage of modules based on their file paths.
