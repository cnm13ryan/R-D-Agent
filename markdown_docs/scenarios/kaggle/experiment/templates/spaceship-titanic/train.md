## FunctionDef compute_metrics_for_classification(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_metrics_for_classification**: This function calculates and returns the accuracy metric for a classification task.

parameters:
路 y_true: The true labels of the dataset, representing the actual outcomes.
路 y_pred: The predicted labels generated by the model, which are compared against the true labels to compute the accuracy.

Code Description: The function `compute_metrics_for_classification` takes two primary inputs: `y_true`, which contains the ground truth labels for a set of samples, and `y_pred`, which includes the predicted labels produced by a classification model. It uses the `accuracy_score` function from an external library (presumably scikit-learn) to compute the accuracy of the predictions. Accuracy is defined as the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances in the dataset. The computed accuracy value is then returned.

Note: This function assumes that the `accuracy_score` function is available in the current namespace, likely imported from a library such as scikit-learn. It is important for users to ensure that this dependency is installed and correctly imported before using the function. Additionally, both `y_true` and `y_pred` should be of compatible formats (e.g., lists or arrays) and contain the same number of elements.

Output Example: If `y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0]` and `y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 0]`, the function would return an accuracy score of `0.75`, indicating that 75% of the predictions were correct.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path. It allows users to load modules at runtime, which can be particularly useful for modular programming or when working with plugins.

parameters:
路 module_name: A string representing the name of the module you wish to import. This name is used internally and does not affect how the module functions once imported.
路 module_path: A string that specifies the file path to the Python module (.py file) you want to import.

Code Description: The function utilizes the `importlib.util` module, which provides utilities for importing modules programmatically. It first creates a module specification using `spec_from_file_location`, providing it with the desired module name and its file path. This specification contains all necessary information about how to load the module. Next, it creates a new module based on this specification using `module_from_spec`. Finally, it executes the module in its own namespace using `exec_module` from the loader attached to the specification, effectively running the code contained within the specified Python file and making its contents available as a module object.

Note: This function is particularly useful when you need to load modules dynamically at runtime, such as when implementing plugin systems or when working with configurations that specify which modules should be loaded. It requires that the path provided points to a valid Python file (.py).

Output Example: If there were a Python file located at '/path/to/my_module.py' containing a function `greet` defined as follows:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello from my module!")
```

Using `import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')` would return a module object that has the `greet` function available. You could then call this function using `module.greet()`, which would output "Hello from my module!".
