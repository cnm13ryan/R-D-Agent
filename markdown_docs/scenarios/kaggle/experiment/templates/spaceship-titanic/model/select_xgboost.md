## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to process a pandas DataFrame by selecting relevant features. It currently assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns (hierarchical), the function flattens these columns into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace from the resulting string. The modified DataFrame with flattened column names is then returned.

Note: Usage points include preprocessing datasets before fitting models, especially when dealing with datasets that have multi-level column structures. The function can be expanded to include more sophisticated feature selection logic in future iterations.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns like this:
```
         Passenger
          Age  Fare
0        22   7.25
1        38  71.28
```

The function would output a DataFrame with flattened column names:
```
   Passenger_Age  Passenger_Fare
0           22.0            7.25
1           38.0           71.28
```
