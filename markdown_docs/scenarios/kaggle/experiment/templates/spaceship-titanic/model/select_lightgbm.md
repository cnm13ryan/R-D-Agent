## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single-level or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is one, indicating that all columns are already at a single level. If this condition is met, it returns the DataFrame `X` as is. Otherwise, it proceeds to flatten any multi-level column names into single-level names. This is achieved by joining each tuple of multi-level column names into a single string with underscores separating the levels. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to the DataFrame's columns attribute.

Note: While this function currently does not perform actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for handling multi-level column names, which is a common scenario in datasets where hierarchical or nested data structures are used. Developers can extend this function by adding logic to filter out irrelevant or redundant features based on specific criteria.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has columns named ('level1', 'level2') and ('level3',), the output will be a DataFrame with columns renamed to 'level1_level2' and 'level3'. Assuming all features are relevant, no feature selection occurs beyond this renaming process.
