## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes that all features in the DataFrame are relevant. However, the function includes logic for handling MultiIndex columns by flattening them into single-level column names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected.

Code Description: The function first checks if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns are relevant. If the DataFrame has MultiIndex columns (more than one level), the function flattens these multi-level column names into a single string by joining each tuple of column levels with an underscore `_` and then strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the resulting strings. This flattened list of column names is then assigned back to `X.columns`, effectively converting the MultiIndex columns to a simple Index.

Note: The function's current implementation does not perform actual feature selection based on relevance criteria but rather focuses on handling MultiIndex columns by flattening them. Developers can extend this function to include more sophisticated feature selection logic if needed.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has MultiIndex columns like `[('Passenger', 'Age'), ('Passenger', 'Class')]`, the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names `['Passenger_Age', 'Passenger_Class']`. If `X` already has single-level column names, it will return unchanged.
