## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset. It can have either single-level or multi-level column names.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all features are relevant. If the DataFrame has multiple levels of column names, the function flattens these into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of multi-level column names into a single string with underscores separating the original levels. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`. Finally, the modified DataFrame `X` is returned.

**Note**: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic by handling multi-level columns. Developers can extend this function to include actual feature selection criteria as needed.

**Output Example**: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level column names like `[('Passenger', 'ID'), ('Passenger', 'Age')]`, the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names `['Passenger_ID', 'Passenger_Age']`. If all columns are already single-level, the output will be identical to the input.
