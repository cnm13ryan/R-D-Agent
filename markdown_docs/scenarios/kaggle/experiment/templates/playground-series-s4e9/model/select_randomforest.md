## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The DataFrame can have either single or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is one, indicating that all columns are already at a single level. If this condition is met, it returns the DataFrame `X` as is without any modifications. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns, the function proceeds to flatten these columns into a single level. This is achieved by iterating over each column name (which is a tuple in case of multi-level columns), converting each element of the tuple to a string, joining them with underscores, and then stripping any leading or trailing whitespace from the resulting string. The modified column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`, effectively flattening the multi-level structure into single-level column names.

Note: This function is intended for use within fit and predict functions where feature selection might be a necessary preprocessing step. Currently, it does not perform any actual feature selection but provides flexibility for future enhancements by handling multi-level columns appropriately.

Output Example: Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns such as:

```
         A        B
       1 2      3 4
0    1.1 1.2  1.3 1.4
1    2.1 2.2  2.3 2.4
```

The function will return:

```
   A_1  A_2  B_3  B_4
0  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4
1  2.1  2.2  2.3  2.4
```
