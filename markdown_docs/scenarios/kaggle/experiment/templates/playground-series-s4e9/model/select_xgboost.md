## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected. It can have either single-level or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all columns are relevant. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names, the function flattens these into single-level names by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore `_`. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over `X.columns.values`, converting each tuple to a string and stripping any extra whitespace. The modified column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`, and the updated DataFrame is returned.

Note: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic by handling multi-level columns. Developers can expand upon this function to implement more sophisticated feature selection techniques as needed.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level column names like `[('feature', '1'), ('feature', '2')]`, the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names `['feature_1', 'feature_2']`. If all columns are already single-level, the output will simply be the original DataFrame `X`.
