## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset. The function expects this DataFrame to potentially have multi-level column names that need to be flattened.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is 1, indicating that all columns are already single-level. If true, it returns the DataFrame as is without any modification. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns (more than one level), the function flattens these columns into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore and converting them to strings. The resulting flattened column names are then assigned back to the DataFrame's columns, effectively reducing the column hierarchy to a single level.

**Note**: While this function currently does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a mechanism for handling multi-level column names which can be useful in preprocessing steps before model training. Future enhancements could include more sophisticated feature selection logic.

**Output Example**: If the input DataFrame `X` has columns like `[('feature1', 'subfeat1'), ('feature2', 'subfeat2')]`, the function will return a DataFrame with columns renamed to `['feature1_subfeat1', 'feature2_subfeat2']`. This transformation ensures that all column names are single-level strings, which is often required for compatibility with machine learning models.
