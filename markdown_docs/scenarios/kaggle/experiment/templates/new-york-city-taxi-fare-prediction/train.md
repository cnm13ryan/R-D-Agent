## FunctionDef compute_metrics_for_classification(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_metrics_for_classification**: This function calculates the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate the quality of binary classifications.

parameters:
路 y_true: A list or array-like structure containing the true class labels.
路 y_pred: A list or array-like structure containing the predicted class labels from a classification model.

Code Description: The function compute_metrics_for_classification is designed to assess the performance of a classification model by computing the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). MCC is a balanced measure that can be used even if classes are of very different sizes. It returns a value between -1 and +1, where +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction, and -1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation.

The function takes two main arguments: y_true, which contains the actual class labels for the dataset, and y_pred, which contains the predicted class labels generated by a classification model. It uses the matthews_corrcoef function from an external library (presumably scikit-learn) to compute the MCC based on these inputs.

Note: This function is specifically tailored for binary classification problems. For multi-class classification scenarios, additional metrics or modifications might be necessary.

Output Example: If y_true = [1, 0, 1, 1] and y_pred = [1, 0, 0, 1], the output of compute_metrics_for_classification would be approximately 0.577, indicating a moderate level of correlation between predicted and actual class labels.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path. It utilizes the `importlib` library to create a module specification, instantiate the module based on that specification, and then execute it.

parameters:
路 module_name: A string representing the name of the module to be imported.
路 module_path: A string indicating the file system path where the Python module is located.

Code Description: The function begins by creating a module specification using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`, which takes two arguments: the name of the module and its file path. This step prepares the necessary information for loading the module. Next, it creates an empty module object from this specification with `importlib.util.module_from_spec`. Afterward, the function executes the module in its own namespace using `spec.loader.exec_module`, effectively running all top-level code within the specified Python file and attaching any defined classes, functions, or variables to the module object. Finally, it returns the fully loaded module.

Note: This function is particularly useful when you need to import modules dynamically at runtime based on their file paths rather than their names in the standard Python package structure. It allows for flexibility in how and where modules are stored and accessed within a project.

Output Example: If there were a Python file located at '/path/to/my_module.py' containing a function `greet` that prints "Hello, World!", calling `import_module_from_path('my_module', '/path/to/my_module.py')` would return a module object. You could then access the `greet` function from this returned module by using `module.greet()`, which would print "Hello, World!".
