## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame intended for use in machine learning model fitting and prediction processes, specifically tailored for scenarios like the New York City Taxi Fare Prediction challenge.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset with potential feature columns that need to be processed or selected. The DataFrame can have either single-level or multi-level column names.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels == 1`. If this condition is true, it implies that all features are considered relevant at this stage, and thus, the function returns the DataFrame as is without any modifications. This approach assumes that no feature selection logic is applied in this initial version.

If the DataFrame has multi-level column names (i.e., `X.columns.nlevels` is not equal to 1), the function proceeds to flatten these multi-level columns into single-level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore `_`. This transformation is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over each column name in `X.columns.values`, converting each tuple into a string where elements are joined by underscores. The resulting list of strings is then assigned back to `X.columns`, effectively flattening the multi-level structure.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where feature selection or preprocessing steps are necessary before feeding data into machine learning models, particularly in complex datasets with hierarchical column structures. In this specific function, while no actual feature selection logic is implemented (all features are considered relevant), the capability to handle and flatten multi-level columns is provided, which can be useful for preparing data for further processing.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level column names:
```
         pickup  dropoff
          lat    lat
0        40.7   41.8
1        39.5   42.6
```

The function will output a DataFrame with flattened column names:
```
     pickup_lat  dropoff_lat
0          40.7         41.8
1          39.5         42.6
```
