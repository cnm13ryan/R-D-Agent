## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with an underscore separator.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset. It may have either single-level or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If this condition is true, it simply returns the DataFrame as all features are considered relevant at this stage. However, if the DataFrame contains multi-level columns, the function proceeds to flatten these columns into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column levels into a string separated by underscores and then stripping any extra whitespace. The modified DataFrame with flattened column names is then returned.

Note: Although the current implementation does not perform actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for handling multi-level columns, which can be useful in more complex scenarios where feature selection logic might be integrated later.

Output Example: Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level column names such as `[('pickup', 'latitude'), ('pickup', 'longitude')]`, the function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names like `['pickup_latitude', 'pickup_longitude']`. If the input DataFrame already has single-level columns, it will be returned unchanged.
