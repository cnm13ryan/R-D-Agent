## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame intended for use in machine learning models such as those used in fitting and predicting functions, particularly in the context of feature engineering.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected or processed. The DataFrame may have multi-level columns.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function assumes all features are relevant and returns the DataFrame as is without any modifications. This assumption can be expanded to include more sophisticated feature selection logic in future implementations.

If the DataFrame has multi-level columns, the function flattens these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore `_`. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the resulting string. This step ensures that the DataFrame's columns are simplified and standardized for further processing in machine learning pipelines.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where feature selection or preprocessing is necessary before feeding data into a model. In its current form, this function serves as a placeholder for more complex feature selection logic but can be easily modified to implement such logic.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns like:
```
         pickup  dropoff
            lat      lat
0        40.71   40.72
1        40.69   40.73
```

The function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names:
```
    pickup_lat  dropoff_lat
0       40.71        40.72
1       40.69        40.73
```
