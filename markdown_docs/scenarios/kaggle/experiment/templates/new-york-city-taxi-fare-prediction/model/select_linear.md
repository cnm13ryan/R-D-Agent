## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame. It is intended to be used within fit and predict functions, particularly in scenarios where feature selection might be necessary for model training and prediction.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If this condition is met, it implies that no multi-level columns are present, and thus, all features are considered relevant, and the original DataFrame is returned as is. However, if the DataFrame contains multi-level columns (hierarchical columns), the function proceeds to flatten these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This transformation ensures that the resulting DataFrame has a simple, flat structure suitable for further processing in machine learning pipelines.

**Note**: The current implementation assumes all features are relevant initially. Future enhancements could include more sophisticated feature selection logic to improve model performance.

**Output Example**: Given a DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns such as:
```
         pickup  dropoff
            lat      lat
0       40.7128  40.6394
1       40.7152  40.7306
```

The function would transform it into a DataFrame with flattened column names:
```
   pickup_lat  dropoff_lat
0    40.7128      40.6394
1    40.7152      40.7306
```
