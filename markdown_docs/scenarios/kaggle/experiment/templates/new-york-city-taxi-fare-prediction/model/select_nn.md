## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function selects relevant features from a given DataFrame to be used in fit and predict functions of a machine learning model. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but can be expanded for more sophisticated feature selection logic.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset with potential features for the model.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has single-level column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If true, indicating that no multi-level columns are present, it returns the DataFrame as is. Otherwise, it flattens any multi-level column names into a single level by joining each tuple of column levels with an underscore and stripping any whitespace. This flattened list of column names is then assigned back to `X.columns`, ensuring uniformity in column naming before returning the modified DataFrame.

Note: The function currently does not perform any actual feature selection but rather prepares the DataFrame for use in subsequent steps, such as model training or prediction. Developers can extend this function to include more advanced feature selection techniques based on domain knowledge or statistical methods.

Output Example: If `X` is a DataFrame with multi-level columns like `pd.DataFrame({('a', 'b'): [1, 2], ('c', 'd'): [3, 4]})`, the output will be a DataFrame with single-level column names `pd.DataFrame({'a_b': [1, 2], 'c_d': [3, 4]})`. If `X` already has single-level columns, it will return unchanged.
