## ClassDef DatetimeFeature
DatetimeFeature: This class is designed to perform feature engineering on datetime-related data within a DataFrame, specifically focusing on extracting meaningful components from a 'pickup_datetime' column.

attributes:
路 train_df: A pandas DataFrame containing the training dataset with a 'pickup_datetime' column formatted as "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC". This attribute is used during the fit method.
路 X: A pandas DataFrame that will be transformed by extracting datetime features from the 'pickup_datetime' column. Used in the transform method.

Code Description: The DatetimeFeature class includes two methods, `fit` and `transform`. The `fit` method is currently a placeholder as no specific fitting process is required for this feature extraction task. The `transform` method processes the input DataFrame by first converting the 'pickup_datetime' column to datetime objects using pandas' `to_datetime` function with the specified format. It then extracts several components from these datetime objects: hour, day, month, weekday, and year, creating new columns in the DataFrame for each of these features. After extracting these features, the original 'pickup_datetime' column is dropped from the DataFrame to clean up unnecessary data.

Note: This class assumes that the input DataFrame contains a 'pickup_datetime' column formatted as "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC". The `fit` method does not perform any operations and can be expanded if future preprocessing steps are needed. The `transform` method modifies the input DataFrame in place by adding new columns for extracted datetime features and removing the original 'pickup_datetime' column.

Output Example: Given an input DataFrame with a 'pickup_datetime' column, the output will include additional columns for hour, day, month, weekday, and year, with the 'pickup_datetime' column removed. For instance:

Original DataFrame:
| pickup_datetime          |
|--------------------------|
| 2019-01-01 00:30:00 UTC  |
| 2019-01-01 05:45:00 UTC  |

Transformed DataFrame:
| hour | day | month | weekday | year |
|------|-----|-------|---------|------|
|    0 |   1 |     1 |       3 | 2019 |
|    5 |   1 |     1 |       3 | 2019 |

In this example, the 'pickup_datetime' column has been replaced by five new columns representing different components of the date and time.
### FunctionDef fit(self, train_df)
**fit**: This function is designed to fit a feature engineering model using training data. It prepares the model by analyzing the input dataset, which is essential for subsequent transformations or predictions.

**parameters**:
路 train_df: A pandas DataFrame containing the training data. This DataFrame should include all necessary features and labels required for fitting the feature engineering model.

**Code Description**: The function `fit` takes a single parameter, `train_df`, which is expected to be a pandas DataFrame. Currently, the function body contains only a pass statement, indicating that no operations are performed within this method. In practice, the `fit` method would typically involve analyzing the training data to identify patterns, statistics, or other characteristics necessary for feature engineering tasks. This could include calculating means, medians, standard deviations, or any other relevant metrics that will be used in transforming new data.

**Note**: Usage points include ensuring that the input DataFrame is correctly formatted and contains all required features before calling this method. Developers should also note that while this function currently does nothing, it serves as a placeholder for future implementation where actual fitting logic would reside. This setup allows for a structured approach to feature engineering within a machine learning pipeline.

### FunctionDef transform(self, X)
**transform**: This function processes a DataFrame by extracting various time-related features from a datetime column named "pickup_datetime" and then removes the original datetime column.

parameters:
路 X: A pandas DataFrame that must contain a column named "pickup_datetime" with date and time information formatted as "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC".

Code Description: The function starts by converting the values in the "pickup_datetime" column to datetime objects using pandas' `to_datetime` method, specifying the format of the input strings. It then extracts several new features from this datetime column:
- **hour**: The hour of the day when the pickup occurred.
- **day**: The day of the month for the pickup.
- **month**: The month of the year for the pickup.
- **weekday**: The day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.
- **year**: The year of the pickup.

After extracting these features, the function drops the original "pickup_datetime" column from the DataFrame to clean up unnecessary data. Finally, it returns the modified DataFrame with the new time-based features included.

Note: It's important that the input DataFrame X contains a correctly formatted "pickup_datetime" column; otherwise, the `to_datetime` conversion will fail or produce incorrect results. The function modifies the DataFrame in place and also returns it, which is useful for chaining transformations.

Output Example: Given an initial DataFrame with a "pickup_datetime" column like this:

| pickup_datetime         |
|-------------------------|
| 2018-01-01 00:34:56 UTC |
| 2019-07-15 12:45:30 UTC |

The function would transform it into:

| hour | day | month | weekday | year |
|------|-----|-------|---------|------|
|    0 |   1 |     1 |       6 | 2018 |
|   12 |  15 |     7 |       0 | 2019 |

This output includes the extracted time features and excludes the original "pickup_datetime" column.
