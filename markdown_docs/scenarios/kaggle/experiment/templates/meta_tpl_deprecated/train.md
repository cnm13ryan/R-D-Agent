## FunctionDef compute_metrics_for_classification(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_metrics_for_classification**: This function calculates the accuracy metric for a classification task by comparing true labels against predicted labels.

parameters:
· y_true: A list, array, or similar iterable containing the actual class labels.
· y_pred: A list, array, or similar iterable containing the predicted class labels from a model.

Code Description: The function compute_metrics_for_classification is designed to evaluate the performance of a classification model by calculating its accuracy. Accuracy is defined as the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances in the dataset. It uses the `accuracy_score` function from an external library, likely scikit-learn, which takes two arguments: y_true (the true labels) and y_pred (the predicted labels). The result, stored in the variable accuracy, is then returned by the function.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where a binary or multi-class classification model's performance needs to be assessed. It is essential that both y_true and y_pred are of the same length and contain corresponding elements for accurate computation.

Output Example: If y_true = [0, 1, 2, 2] and y_pred = [0, 0, 2, 2], the function will return an accuracy score of 0.75, indicating that 75% of the predictions were correct.
## FunctionDef compute_metrics_for_classification(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_metrics_for_classification**: This function calculates the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for a classification task, which is a measure of the quality of binary classifications.

parameters:
· y_true: A list or array-like structure containing the true labels.
· y_pred: A list or array-like structure containing the predicted labels by the model.

Code Description: The function takes two parameters, `y_true` and `y_pred`, representing the actual and predicted labels respectively. It computes the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) using the `matthews_corrcoef` function from a library such as scikit-learn. MCC is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets because it considers true and false positives and negatives, providing a more balanced measure than accuracy.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where binary classification performance needs to be evaluated, especially in cases of class imbalance. It's important that `y_true` and `y_pred` are aligned correctly, meaning they should correspond to the same instances.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If `y_true = [0, 1, 0, 1]` and `y_pred = [0, 1, 1, 0]`, the function would return an MCC value close to -0.33, indicating a poor predictive performance due to the misclassification of two out of four instances. An MCC value of +1 indicates perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction, and -1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path. It utilizes the `importlib` library to create a module specification, instantiate the module, and execute it within the current environment.

parameters:
· module_name: A string representing the name of the module you wish to import.
· module_path: A string representing the absolute or relative file system path to the Python file containing the module.

Code Description: The function begins by creating a module specification using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location()`, which takes two arguments: the name of the module and its file location. This specification contains all necessary information about how to load the module from the given path. Next, it creates an empty module object with `importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)`. The module is then executed in its own namespace using `spec.loader.exec_module(module)`, which effectively runs the code contained within the file at the specified location as part of the newly created module object. Finally, the function returns this module object, allowing the caller to access any functions, classes, or variables defined within it.

Note: This function is particularly useful in scenarios where modules are not located in directories that are part of the Python path, or when you need to load a module dynamically based on runtime conditions. It provides flexibility in managing and loading Python code.

Output Example: If `module_path` points to a file containing the following code:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
Calling `import_module_from_path('greet_module', 'path/to/greet.py')` would return a module object. You could then use this returned object to call the `greet` function like so: `module.greet("Alice")`, which would output `"Hello, Alice!"`.
