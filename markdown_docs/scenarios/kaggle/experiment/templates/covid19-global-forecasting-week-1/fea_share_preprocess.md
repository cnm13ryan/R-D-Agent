## FunctionDef prepreprocess
**prepreprocess**: This function loads COVID-19 global forecasting data from CSV files, preprocesses it by combining train and test datasets, converting dates to datetime objects, creating new features based on day, month, and year, encoding categorical variables, splitting back into train and test sets, preparing features and targets, and finally splitting the training set into training and validation subsets.

**parameters**:
· No explicit parameters are defined. The function directly accesses files located at "/kaggle/input/train.csv" and "/kaggle/input/test.csv".

**Code Description**: 
The function starts by loading the train and test datasets from specified CSV file paths using pandas' `read_csv` method. It then combines these two datasets into a single DataFrame named `all_data` for preprocessing purposes.

Next, it converts the "Date" column in `all_data` to datetime objects using pandas' `to_datetime` function. This conversion facilitates easier manipulation and extraction of date-related features.

The function proceeds by creating new columns in `all_data`: "Day", "Month", and "Year". These are derived from the "Date" column, representing the day, month, and year components of each date respectively.

To handle categorical variables ("Country/Region" and "Province/State"), a LabelEncoder object is instantiated. The function applies this encoder to transform these columns into numerical values. Missing values in the "Province/State" column are filled with "None" before encoding.

After preprocessing, `all_data` is split back into separate train and test DataFrames based on whether the "ForecastId" column contains a value or not (indicating training data if NaN).

The function then defines a list of features to be used in modeling: "Country/Region", "Province/State", "Day", "Month", and "Year". It extracts these features from the train DataFrame into `X` and assigns the target variables ("ConfirmedCases" and "Fatalities") to `y`.

Finally, the function splits the training data (`X` and `y`) into training and validation sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` method with a test size of 20% and a fixed random state for reproducibility. The function returns these four datasets along with the features from the test set and their corresponding forecast IDs.

**Note**: This function assumes that the necessary libraries (pandas, sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder, sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split) are imported in the script where this function is called. It also directly accesses file paths which should be available in the environment where the code runs.

**Output Example**: 
The function returns six objects:
- `X_train`: A DataFrame containing training features.
- `X_valid`: A DataFrame containing validation features.
- `y_train`: A DataFrame containing training targets (ConfirmedCases and Fatalities).
- `y_valid`: A DataFrame containing validation targets.
- `test[features]`: A DataFrame containing test features.
- `test["ForecastId"]`: A Series containing forecast IDs for the test set.

|----------------|----------------|-----|-------|------|

## FunctionDef preprocess_script
**preprocess_script**: This function checks if preprocessed data files exist in a specified directory. If they do, it loads these files into DataFrames; otherwise, it calls another function to preprocess the data from raw CSV files, saves the processed data for future use, and then returns the necessary datasets.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters are defined. The function directly accesses file paths located at "/kaggle/input/" for loading or saving preprocessed data.

Code Description: 
The function begins by checking if a specific pickle file ("X_train.pkl") exists in the "/kaggle/input/" directory using `os.path.exists`. If this file and others (X_valid.pkl, y_train.pkl, y_valid.pkl, X_test.pkl, forecast_ids.pkl) are found, it loads them into respective DataFrames using pandas' `read_pickle` method. This step is intended to avoid redundant preprocessing if the data has already been processed.

If the pickle files do not exist, indicating that the data needs preprocessing, the function calls `prepreprocess`. This function handles the loading and preprocessing of raw CSV files ("train.csv" and "test.csv") into a format suitable for machine learning models. After preprocessing, the resulting DataFrames are saved as pickle files in the "/kaggle/input/" directory using pandas' `to_pickle` method to ensure they can be reused in future runs without reprocessing.

The function then returns six DataFrames: `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, `y_valid`, `X_test`, and `forecast_ids`. These datasets are essential for training, validating, and testing a machine learning model on the COVID-19 global forecasting data.

Note: This function assumes that the necessary libraries (pandas, os) are imported in the script where this function is called. It also directly accesses file paths which should be available in the environment where the code runs.

Output Example:
The function returns six objects:
- `X_train`: A DataFrame containing training features.
- `X_valid`: A DataFrame containing validation features.
- `y_train`: A DataFrame containing training targets (ConfirmedCases and Fatalities).
- `y_valid`: A DataFrame containing validation targets.
- `X_test`: A DataFrame containing test features.
- `forecast_ids`: A Series containing forecast IDs for the test set.
