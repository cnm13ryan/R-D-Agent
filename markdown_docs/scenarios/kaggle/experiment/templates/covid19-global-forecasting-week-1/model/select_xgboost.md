## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. It assumes all features are relevant initially but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's column index is 1, indicating that all columns are already at a single level. If this condition is met, it simply returns the original DataFrame `X` without any modifications. However, if the DataFrame has multi-level columns (more than one level), the function proceeds to flatten these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over the values of `X.columns`, converting each tuple of column names into a string where individual levels are joined. The resulting list of flattened column names replaces the original multi-level column index, and the modified DataFrame is then returned.

Note: While the function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic by handling multi-level columns. Developers can extend this function to include actual feature selection techniques based on domain knowledge or statistical methods.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns like (('Country', 'US'), ('Date', '2020-01-22')), the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names such as 'Country_US' and 'Date_2020-01-22'. For single-level columns, the output will be identical to the input.
