## FunctionDef fit(X_train, y_train, X_valid, y_valid)
**fit**: Define and train the model for both ConfirmedCases and Fatalities using XGBoost.
parameters:
· X_train: A pandas DataFrame containing the training features.
· y_train: A pandas DataFrame containing the training labels, specifically the columns 'ConfirmedCases' and 'Fatalities'.
· X_valid: A pandas DataFrame containing the validation features.
· y_valid: A pandas DataFrame containing the validation labels, specifically the columns 'ConfirmedCases' and 'Fatalities'.

Code Description: The function `fit` is designed to train two separate XGBoost models, one for predicting confirmed cases of a disease (such as COVID-19) and another for predicting fatalities. It iterates over each target ('ConfirmedCases', 'Fatalities') and prepares the training (`dtrain`) and validation (`dvalid`) datasets using `xgb.DMatrix`, which is an optimized data structure used by XGBoost to store a dataset in memory.

For each model, specific parameters are set:
- "objective": Specifies that the task is regression with squared error loss.
- "eval_metric": Uses root mean square error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric during training.
- "nthread": Utilizes all available CPU threads for parallel processing.
- "tree_method": Employs 'gpu_hist' to build trees, which is optimized for GPU usage.
- "device": Specifies that computations should be performed on a CUDA-enabled device.

The function trains each model for up to 1000 rounds (iterations) and uses early stopping based on the validation set's performance. Early stopping halts training when there is no improvement in RMSE on the validation set for 50 consecutive rounds, which helps prevent overfitting.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the input DataFrames (`X_train`, `y_train`, `X_valid`, `y_valid`) are correctly formatted and contain the necessary columns. Additionally, having a CUDA-enabled GPU is recommended to leverage the 'gpu_hist' tree method for faster training times.

Output Example: The function returns a dictionary with two keys, 'ConfirmedCases' and 'Fatalities', each mapping to an XGBoost model object that has been trained on the respective target variable.
{
    "ConfirmedCases": <xgboost.core.Booster object at 0x7f8b1c234a90>,
    "Fatalities": <xgboost.core.Booster object at 0x7f8b1c234b50>
}
## FunctionDef predict(models, X)
**predict**: This function generates predictions for both ConfirmedCases and Fatalities using pre-trained XGBoost models.

parameters:
· models: A dictionary where keys are target names ('ConfirmedCases' and 'Fatalities') and values are trained XGBoost model objects.
· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the input features used to make predictions.

Code Description: The function starts by converting the input DataFrame `X` into an XGBoost DMatrix, which is a specialized data structure that XGBoost uses for efficient computation. It then initializes an empty dictionary named `predictions`. For each target (either 'ConfirmedCases' or 'Fatalities'), it retrieves the corresponding model from the `models` dictionary and makes predictions using the `predict` method of the model on the DMatrix `dtest`. These predictions are stored in the `predictions` dictionary under their respective target keys. Finally, the function returns a pandas DataFrame constructed from the `predictions` dictionary, where each column corresponds to a target and contains the predicted values.

Note: The input features in `X` must match those used during the training of the models for accurate predictions. Additionally, ensure that all necessary libraries such as xgboost and pandas are imported before using this function.

Output Example: If the function is called with a dictionary containing two trained XGBoost models (one for 'ConfirmedCases' and one for 'Fatalities') and an input DataFrame `X` with 5 samples, the output might look like this:

predictions_df:
   ConfirmedCases  Fatalities
0            1234          56
1             890          34
2            1567          78
3            2345         102
4            3456         120

Each row in the DataFrame corresponds to a sample from `X`, and each column represents the predicted number of ConfirmedCases or Fatalities for that sample.
