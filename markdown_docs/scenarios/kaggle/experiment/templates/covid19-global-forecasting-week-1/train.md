## FunctionDef compute_rmsle(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_rmsle**: This function calculates the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of regression models, particularly when dealing with data that spans several orders of magnitude.

parameters:
路 y_true: An array-like structure containing the true values. These are the actual outcomes or observations from the dataset.
路 y_pred: An array-like structure containing the predicted values. These are the forecasted or estimated outcomes generated by a regression model.

Code Description: The function `compute_rmsle` takes two primary inputs, `y_true` and `y_pred`, which represent the true and predicted values respectively. It computes the RMSLE by first calculating the Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE) using the `mean_squared_log_error` function from a library such as scikit-learn. The MSLE is essentially the average of the squared differences between the logarithms of the true and predicted values, which helps in penalizing underestimates more than overestimates. Finally, it returns the square root of this MSLE value to obtain the RMSLE.

Note: It's important that both `y_true` and `y_pred` are positive since the logarithm of non-positive numbers is undefined. Additionally, RMSLE is particularly useful in scenarios where the magnitude of errors relative to the true values is more critical than the absolute error.

Output Example: If `y_true = [3, -0.5, 2, 7]` and `y_pred = [2.5, 0.3, 2, 8]`, the function would first need to filter out or handle non-positive values in `y_true` since RMSLE cannot be computed with them. Assuming all values are positive, a possible output could be approximately `0.174`. However, given the presence of negative values in `y_true`, this example illustrates the necessity for preprocessing data before computing RMSLE.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path. It utilizes the `importlib` library to create a module specification, instantiate a new module based on that specification, and then execute the module in its own namespace.

parameters:
路 module_name: A string representing the name of the module you wish to import. This name is used internally by Python's import system.
路 module_path: A string representing the file path to the Python file containing the module code.

Code Description: The function begins by creating a module specification using `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`. This step prepares the necessary information for importing the module, including its location on disk. Next, it creates a new module object from this specification with `importlib.util.module_from_spec`. After the module is created, the code executes the module in its own namespace using `spec.loader.exec_module(module)`, effectively running all top-level code within the file and making any defined functions or classes available for use. Finally, the function returns the newly imported module object.

Note: This approach is particularly useful when you need to import modules dynamically at runtime, such as when the module's location is determined programmatically or when working with plugins or extensions that are not known until execution time.

Output Example: If `module_path` points to a file containing the following code:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello from the imported module!")
```
Then calling `import_module_from_path('my_dynamic_module', '/path/to/my_dynamic_module.py')` would return a module object. You could then call `greet()` on this returned object like so: `module.greet()`, which would output "Hello from the imported module!".
