## FunctionDef prepreprocess
**prepreprocess**: This function loads a dataset from a specified CSV file, removes unnecessary columns, and splits the data into training and validation sets for further machine learning model development.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The function does not accept any input arguments directly. It operates on a predefined path to load the dataset.

Code Description: The function begins by loading a dataset from "/kaggle/input/train.csv" using pandas' `read_csv` method, storing it in a DataFrame named `data_df`. It then removes the "Id" column as it is deemed unnecessary for the subsequent analysis or model training. Following this, the function separates the features (X) and the target variable (y). The target variable, "Cover_Type", is adjusted by subtracting 1 from each value to align with zero-based indexing commonly used in machine learning frameworks.

The dataset is then split into training (`X_train`, `y_train`) and validation (`X_valid`, `y_valid`) sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function. The split ratio is set at 80% for the training set and 20% for the validation set, with a fixed random state of 42 to ensure reproducibility of results.

Note: Usage points. This function is particularly useful in the initial stages of a machine learning project where data preparation is crucial. It automates the process of loading, cleaning, and splitting the dataset, which are essential steps before model training can begin.

Output Example: The function returns four arrays or DataFrames:
- `X_train`: Training features
- `X_valid`: Validation features
- `y_train`: Training labels (adjusted to be zero-indexed)
- `y_valid`: Validation labels (also adjusted to be zero-indexed)

For instance, if the dataset contains 1000 samples with 54 features each, and after splitting, you might have:
- `X_train` with shape (800, 53) representing 80% of the data excluding the "Id" column
- `y_train` with shape (800,) containing the corresponding labels for training
- `X_valid` with shape (200, 53) representing the remaining 20% of the features
- `y_valid` with shape (200,) holding the labels for validation purposes
## FunctionDef preprocess_script
**preprocess_script**: This method applies preprocessing steps to the training, validation, and test datasets. It checks if preprocessed data files exist; if so, it loads them directly. Otherwise, it processes raw CSV data by encoding labels, dropping unnecessary columns, splitting into training and validation sets, and preparing the test dataset.

**parameters**:
· No explicit parameters are defined in the function signature. However, the function implicitly relies on the existence of specific files within a predefined directory structure (`/kaggle/input/`).

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if preprocessed data files (`X_train.pkl`, `X_valid.pkl`, `y_train.pkl`, `y_valid.pkl`, `X_test.pkl`, and `others.pkl`) exist in the `/kaggle/input/` directory. If these files are found, they are loaded using `pd.read_pickle()` and returned as a tuple containing training features (`X_train`), validation features (`X_valid`), training labels (`y_train`), validation labels (`y_valid`), test features (`X_test`), and any additional data stored in `others.pkl`.

If the preprocessed files do not exist, the function proceeds to load raw CSV data from `/kaggle/input/train.csv`. It drops the "Id" column since it is not needed for training. The "Cover_Type" column, which contains the target labels, is encoded using a `LabelEncoder` to convert categorical values into numerical format.

The dataset is then split into features (`X`) and labels (`y`). Two specific columns, "Soil_Type7" and "Soil_Type15", are dropped from the feature set as they might not be useful for the model. The data is further divided into training and validation sets using `train_test_split()` with a test size of 20% and a fixed random state for reproducibility.

Next, the function loads the test dataset from `/kaggle/input/test.csv`. Similar to the training set, it extracts the "Id" column for later use and drops the same two soil type columns. The processed test features (`X_test`) are then returned along with the training and validation datasets, the label encoder used, and the extracted IDs.

**Note**: This function assumes that the necessary input files are correctly placed in the `/kaggle/input/` directory. If preprocessed data is available, it will be loaded directly; otherwise, the raw CSV files must be present for processing.

**Output Example**: Depending on whether preprocessed files exist or not, the output can vary:
- If preprocessed files exist: `(X_train_df, X_valid_df, y_train_series, y_valid_series, X_test_df, others_dict)`
- If preprocessing is performed from raw CSVs: `(X_train_df, X_valid_df, y_train_series, y_valid_series, X_test_df, ids_series, label_encoder_instance)`

Here, `X_train_df`, `X_valid_df`, and `X_test_df` are pandas DataFrames containing the features for training, validation, and testing respectively. `y_train_series` and `y_valid_series` are pandas Series objects holding the corresponding labels. `ids_series` contains the IDs from the test dataset. `others_dict` is a dictionary of any additional data loaded from `others.pkl`. Lastly, `label_encoder_instance` is an instance of `LabelEncoder` used to encode the target variable "Cover_Type".
## FunctionDef clean_and_impute_data(X_train, X_valid, X_test)
**clean_and_impute_data**: This function processes tabular data by handling infinite values, imputing missing values using a mean strategy, and removing duplicate columns.

parameters:
· X_train: A pandas DataFrame representing the training dataset.
· X_valid: A pandas DataFrame representing the validation dataset.
· X_test: A pandas DataFrame representing the test dataset.

Code Description: The function begins by replacing all instances of positive infinity (np.inf) and negative infinity (-np.inf) with NaN values in each of the provided datasets (X_train, X_valid, X_test). This step ensures that infinite values do not interfere with subsequent data processing steps. Following this, a SimpleImputer object is instantiated with a strategy set to "mean". The imputer is first fitted on the training dataset and then used to transform both the validation and test datasets, replacing NaN values with the mean of each respective column from the training dataset. This approach ensures that all datasets are treated consistently during model training and evaluation. Lastly, the function removes any duplicate columns from each dataset by selecting only unique column names.

Note: It is important to apply these preprocessing steps before feeding the data into a machine learning model to ensure that the model receives clean and consistent input data. The removal of duplicate columns helps in reducing redundancy and potential multicollinearity issues which can affect model performance.

Output Example: Given three DataFrames with some infinite values, missing values, and duplicate columns, the function will return three new DataFrames where all infinities are replaced by NaNs, NaNs are imputed using mean strategy, and duplicates are removed. For instance:

Original X_train:
| A | B | C | D |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | inf | 3 | 4 |
| 5 | 6 | -inf | 8 |
| 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |
| 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |

Original X_valid:
| A | B | C | D |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | inf | 23 | 24 |
| 25 | 26 | -inf | 28 |
| 29 | 30 | 31 | 32 |

Original X_test:
| A | B | C | D |
|---|---|---|---|
| 33 | inf | 35 | 36 |
| 37 | 38 | -inf | 40 |
| 41 | 42 | 43 | 44 |

Processed X_train:
| A | B | C | D |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | NaN | 3 | 4 |
| 5 | 6 | NaN | 8 |
| 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |
| 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |

Processed X_valid:
| A | B | C | D |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | NaN | 23 | 24 |
| 25 | 26 | NaN | 28 |
| 29 | 30 | 31 | 32 |

Processed X_test:
| A | B | C | D |
|---|---|---|---|
| 33 | NaN | 35 | 36 |
| 37 | 38 | NaN | 40 |
| 41 | 42 | 43 | 44 |

Note: The actual values in the B column after imputation would be the mean of the non-NaN values from the original X_train DataFrame. Duplicate columns, if present, would also be removed in this process.
