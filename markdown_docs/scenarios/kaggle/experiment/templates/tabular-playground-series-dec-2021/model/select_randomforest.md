## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated strings.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all columns are relevant. If the DataFrame has multiple levels in its column names (a MultiIndex), the function flattens these multi-level column names into single-level by joining each tuple of column labels with an underscore `_`. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over the values of `X.columns`, converting each tuple to a string and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The modified column names are then assigned back to `X.columns`, and the DataFrame `X` is returned.

Note: While this function currently does not perform actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework for handling multi-level column names, which can be useful in datasets with complex structures. Developers can extend this function by adding logic to filter or select specific columns based on criteria such as statistical significance, correlation with the target variable, or domain knowledge.

Output Example: If `X` is a DataFrame with multi-level columns like `pd.DataFrame({"A": {"a1": [1], "a2": [2]}, "B": {"b1": [3], "b2": [4]}})`, the function will return a DataFrame with single-level column names `A_a1, A_a2, B_b1, B_b2` and the same data. If all columns are already at a single level, it returns the original DataFrame unchanged.
