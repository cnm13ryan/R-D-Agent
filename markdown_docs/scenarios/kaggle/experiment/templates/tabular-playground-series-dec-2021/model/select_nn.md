## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to process a pandas DataFrame by selecting relevant features. Currently, it assumes all features in the DataFrame are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected or processed.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If this condition is met, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all columns are relevant and no further processing is needed for feature selection. However, if the DataFrame contains multi-level (hierarchical) column names, the function proceeds to flatten these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This transformation ensures that the resulting DataFrame has simple, flat column names which can be more easily handled in subsequent steps such as model training or prediction.

Note: The current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection based on statistical measures or domain knowledge. It merely handles the formatting of column names for consistency and simplicity. Developers may extend this function to include sophisticated feature selection techniques if necessary.

Output Example: Given a DataFrame with multi-level columns like `pd.DataFrame({('feature', 'type1'): [1, 2], ('feature', 'type2'): [3, 4]})`, the output would be a DataFrame with flattened column names such as `pd.DataFrame({'feature_type1': [1, 2], 'feature_type2': [3, 4]})`. If the input DataFrame already has single-level columns, it will be returned unchanged.
