## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame. It is intended to be used within fit and predict functions, particularly in machine learning workflows where feature selection might be necessary.

**parameters**:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is one. If this condition is true, it assumes that all features are relevant and returns the DataFrame as is. This assumption can be expanded upon later to include more sophisticated feature selection logic. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names (more than one level), the function flattens these column names by joining each tuple of column levels into a single string separated by underscores. It then strips any leading or trailing whitespace from these new column names before returning the modified DataFrame.

**Note**: The current implementation does not perform actual feature selection but rather handles multi-level column names, which might be encountered in datasets with complex structures. Developers can extend this function to include more advanced feature selection techniques as needed.

**Output Example**: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns like `[('feature', 'A'), ('feature', 'B')]`, the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names: `['feature_A', 'feature_B']`. If all columns are already single-level, the output will be identical to the input.
