## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a pandas DataFrame. It currently assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated strings.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected or processed.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names. If it does, the function returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. However, if the DataFrame contains multi-level columns (hierarchical column structure), the function flattens these into a single level. This is achieved by joining each tuple of column levels into a single string separated by underscores, effectively creating a unique identifier for each feature. The modified DataFrame with flattened column names is then returned.

Note: While the current implementation does not perform any actual feature selection (it assumes all features are relevant), it provides a framework that can be expanded to include more sophisticated feature selection techniques in the future. Additionally, handling multi-level columns ensures compatibility with datasets that may have been pre-processed or imported from sources using such structures.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns like this:

| ('feature', 'A') | ('feature', 'B') |
|------------------|------------------|
| 1                | 2                |
| 3                | 4                |

The function will return a DataFrame with flattened column names:

| feature_A | feature_B |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 2         |
| 3         | 4         |
