## FunctionDef compute_metrics_for_classification(y_true, y_pred)
**compute_metrics_for_classification**: This function calculates the accuracy metric for a classification task by comparing true labels against predicted labels.

parameters:
路 y_true: The actual target values (ground truth) as a list, array, or similar iterable.
路 y_pred: The predicted target values from the model as a list, array, or similar iterable.

Code Description: The function compute_metrics_for_classification is designed to evaluate the performance of a classification model by calculating its accuracy. Accuracy is a common metric used in classification problems and represents the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances. It uses the `accuracy_score` function from an external library (presumably scikit-learn) to perform this calculation. The function takes two arguments: y_true, which contains the true labels for the dataset, and y_pred, which contains the predicted labels generated by a classification model. After computing the accuracy score, it returns this value as a float.

Note: It is important that both y_true and y_pred are of the same length and contain corresponding elements (i.e., the i-th element in y_true should be the true label for the instance that corresponds to the i-th predicted label in y_pred). This function assumes that `accuracy_score` is available in the current namespace, likely imported from a library such as scikit-learn.

Output Example: If y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0] and y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 0], the function would return an accuracy of 0.75, indicating that 75% of the predictions were correct.
## FunctionDef import_module_from_path(module_name, module_path)
**import_module_from_path**: This function dynamically imports a Python module from a specified file path. It allows users to load modules at runtime, which can be particularly useful for modularizing code or loading plugins.

parameters:
路 module_name: A string representing the name of the module you wish to import.
路 module_path: A string representing the absolute or relative file system path to the Python file containing the module.

Code Description: The function utilizes the `importlib.util` module, which provides support for importing modules programmatically. It starts by creating a specification (spec) for the module using `spec_from_file_location`, where it takes the name of the module and its location on the filesystem as arguments. This specification contains all necessary information about how to load the module.

Next, `module_from_spec` is used to create a new module based on the provided specification. The `exec_module` method of the loader associated with the spec then executes the file in the context of this newly created module, effectively loading it into memory. Finally, the function returns the loaded module object, which can be used like any other imported module.

Note: This approach is useful when you need to load modules dynamically at runtime, such as when working with plugins or extensions that are not known until execution time. It's important to ensure that the file path provided points to a valid Python file and that the module name does not conflict with existing names in your project.

Output Example: If there were a Python file located at 'plugins/my_plugin.py' containing a function `greet`, calling `import_module_from_path('my_plugin', 'plugins/my_plugin.py')` would return a module object. You could then call `my_plugin.greet()` to use the function defined in the plugin.
