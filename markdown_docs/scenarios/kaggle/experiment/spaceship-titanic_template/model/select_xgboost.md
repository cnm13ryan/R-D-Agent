## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. It assumes that all features are initially relevant but includes logic for handling multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features are to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single-level or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all columns are relevant features. If the DataFrame has multiple levels in its column names, the function proceeds to flatten these multi-level columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore `_`. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over the values of `X.columns`, converting each tuple of column names into a string where elements are joined by underscores. The resulting list of concatenated strings is then assigned back to `X.columns`, effectively flattening the multi-level columns. Finally, the function returns the modified DataFrame with single-level column names.

Note: This function currently does not perform any actual feature selection based on statistical or model-based criteria; it merely handles the formatting of column names in cases where they are multi-level. Developers can extend this function to include more sophisticated feature selection logic as needed for their specific use case.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns such as `[('Passenger', 'Age'), ('Passenger', 'Class')]`, the output will be a DataFrame with single-level column names like `['Passenger_Age', 'Passenger_Class']`. If the input DataFrame already has single-level columns, it will be returned unchanged.
