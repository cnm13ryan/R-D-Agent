## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected or processed.

Code Description: The function starts by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is 1. If true, it returns the DataFrame as is, assuming all features are relevant. If the DataFrame has multi-level column names (hierarchical), it flattens these names by joining each level with an underscore and removing any leading or trailing whitespace. This flattened list of column names is then assigned back to `X.columns`, effectively renaming the columns in a single-level format.

Note: The function's current implementation does not perform actual feature selection but rather focuses on handling multi-level column names, which might be encountered when using certain data processing techniques or libraries that generate such structures. Developers can extend this function to include more sophisticated feature selection logic as needed for their specific use case.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has multi-level columns like `[('feature1', 'subfeat1'), ('feature2', 'subfeat2')]`, the output will be a DataFrame with flattened column names such as `['feature1_subfeat1', 'feature2_subfeat2']`. If all columns are already single-level, the output will simply mirror the input DataFrame.
