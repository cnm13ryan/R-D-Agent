## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the DataFrame `X` has a single level of column names using `X.columns.nlevels`. If it does, the function returns `X` as is, assuming all columns are relevant. If the DataFrame has multiple levels in its column names (a MultiIndex), the function flattens these into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore `_`. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over the values of `X.columns`, converting each multi-level column name to a string and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The modified DataFrame, now with flattened column names, is then returned.

Note: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic. Additionally, handling multi-level column names ensures compatibility with datasets that may have been processed in ways that result in such structures.

Output Example: If the input DataFrame `X` has columns named ('level1', 'level2') and ('level3',), the function will return a DataFrame with columns renamed to 'level1_level2' and 'level3'. Assuming all features are relevant, no other changes would be made to the data.
