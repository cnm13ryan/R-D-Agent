## FunctionDef select(X)
**select**: This function is designed to select relevant features from a given DataFrame `X`. Currently, it assumes all features are relevant but includes logic to handle multi-level column names by flattening them into single-level columns with concatenated names.

parameters:
Â· X: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset from which features need to be selected. The DataFrame may have either single-level or multi-level column names.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the number of levels in the DataFrame's columns is one, indicating that all columns are already at a single level. If this condition is met, it returns the DataFrame `X` as is. If the DataFrame has multi-level columns (hierarchical column structure), the function proceeds to flatten these columns into a single level by joining each tuple of column names with an underscore ('_'). This operation ensures that all column names are converted into strings and any leading or trailing whitespace is removed using the `strip()` method. The modified DataFrame, now with flattened column names, is then returned.

Note: While this function currently assumes all features are relevant, it provides a framework for future feature selection logic to be implemented. Additionally, handling multi-level columns ensures compatibility with datasets that may have complex structures.

Output Example: Given an input DataFrame `X` with multi-level columns such as:

| ('Passenger', 'ID') | ('Cabin', 'Deck') | ('Destination', 'Planet') |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 100                 | A                 | TRAPPIST-1e             |
| 200                 | B                 | PSO J318.5-22           |

The function would return a DataFrame with flattened column names:

| Passenger_ID | Cabin_Deck | Destination_Planet |
|--------------|------------|--------------------|
| 100          | A          | TRAPPIST-1e        |
| 200          | B          | PSO J318.5-22      |
