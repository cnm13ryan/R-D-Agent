## ClassDef DMModelRunner
**DMModelRunner**: DMModelRunner is a class designed to manage and execute data mining model experiments within a specified workspace environment. It inherits from CachedRunner, which suggests it utilizes caching mechanisms to optimize performance by storing results of previous executions.

attributes:
· exp: An instance of DMModelExperiment that contains the experiment details, including sub-workspaces and code dictionaries.

Code Description: The class includes a method named develop, decorated with cache_with_pickle. This decorator is likely used to serialize and deserialize the result of the method using pickle, which helps in caching the results for future use without re-execution if the input parameters remain unchanged. Inside the develop method, it first checks if the 'model.py' file exists in the code dictionary of the first sub-workspace within the experiment. If this file is missing or empty, a ModelEmptyError is raised to indicate that no model code is available for execution.

If the 'model.py' file is present, its content is injected into the experiment workspace using the inject_code method. This step prepares the environment by incorporating the necessary model code before execution. The execute method of the experiment workspace is then called with a specified run environment (env_to_use), which sets the PYTHONPATH to the current directory ('./'). The result of this execution is stored in the exp.result attribute, and the modified DMModelExperiment instance is returned.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the 'model.py' file is correctly placed within the sub-workspace's code dictionary before invoking the develop method. Developers should also be aware of the caching mechanism; if changes are made to the model or its dependencies, it may be necessary to clear the cache to ensure the most recent version is executed.

Output Example: The return value of the develop method would be an instance of DMModelExperiment with the result attribute populated by the output from executing 'model.py'. This could include various data structures depending on what the model does, such as a trained model object, evaluation metrics, or other relevant information. For example:

{
    "sub_workspace_list": [...],
    "code_dict": {...},
    "result": {
        "model_performance": {"accuracy": 0.92, "precision": 0.88},
        "trained_model": <TrainedModelObject>
    }
}
### FunctionDef develop(self, exp)
**develop**: This function takes a DMModelExperiment object as input, checks if the necessary model.py file is present and not empty, injects the code from the sub-workspace into the experiment workspace, sets up the environment for execution, runs the experiment, captures the result, and returns the updated DMModelExperiment object.

**parameters**:
· exp: An instance of DMModelExperiment which contains all necessary information about the model development experiment including sub-workspaces and their respective code dictionaries.

**Code Description**: The function starts by checking if the "model.py" file exists in the first sub-workspace's code dictionary. If it does not exist, a ModelEmptyError is raised indicating that the model.py file is empty. Assuming the file is present, the code from this file is injected into the experiment workspace using the inject_code method. The environment for running the experiment is then set up with PYTHONPATH pointing to the current directory. The execute method of the experiment workspace is called with the specified run environment, and the result of this execution is stored in the exp.result attribute. Finally, the function returns the updated DMModelExperiment object which now includes the result of the model development experiment.

**Note**: It is crucial that the "model.py" file exists and contains valid Python code for the experiment to proceed without errors. The environment setup ensures that Python can locate all necessary modules relative to the current directory.

**Output Example**: Assuming the execution was successful, the returned DMModelExperiment object might look like this:

DMModelExperiment(
    sub_workspace_list=[SubWorkspace(code_dict={"model.py": "def predict(x): return x * 2"})],
    experiment_workspace=ExperimentWorkspace(),
    result=ExecutionResult(success=True, output="Successfully executed model", error=None)
)
