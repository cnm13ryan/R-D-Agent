This setup allows for detailed documentation and evaluation of hypotheses within the application or system.

Note: When creating an instance of the Hypothesis class, ensure that all parameters are provided as strings. Each parameter should accurately reflect the intended content to maintain the integrity and usefulness of the hypothesis data.
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: This method returns a string representation of the Hypothesis object, detailing various attributes including the hypothesis itself, reasons, concise summaries of reason, observation, justification, and knowledge.

parameters:
· None: The __str__ method does not accept any parameters as it is designed to provide a string representation of the instance on which it is called.

Code Description: The __str__ method constructs a formatted string that includes multiple attributes of the Hypothesis class. It uses an f-string to embed expressions inside string literals, allowing for easy inclusion and formatting of the object's attributes such as hypothesis, reason, concise_reason, concise_observation, concise_justification, and concise_knowledge. Each attribute is labeled appropriately in the output string, making it clear what each piece of information represents.

Note: This method is automatically invoked when you use the print() function on an instance of the Hypothesis class or when str() is called with a Hypothesis object as its argument. It provides a human-readable summary of the hypothesis and related details, which can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.

Output Example: When __str__ is called on an instance of Hypothesis with the following attributes:
- hypothesis = "The Earth is flat"
- reason = "Because it looks flat to the naked eye"
- concise_reason = "Visual appearance"
- concise_observation = "Horizon appears straight"
- concise_justification = "No curvature visible"
- concise_knowledge = "Basic observation"

The output would be:
Hypothesis: The Earth is flat
                Reason: Because it looks flat to the naked eye
                Concise Reason & Knowledge: Visual appearance
                Concise Observation: Horizon appears straight
                Concise Justification: No curvature visible
                Concise Knowledge: Basic observation
***
## ClassDef HypothesisFeedback
**HypothesisFeedback**: Represents feedback on a hypothesis after an experiment has been conducted. It encapsulates observations made during the experiment, an evaluation of the hypothesis based on these observations, any new hypotheses generated as a result, the reason for the decision regarding the hypothesis, and the final decision itself.

attributes:
· observations: A string containing detailed observations made during the experiment.
· hypothesis_evaluation: A string that evaluates how well the original hypothesis aligns with the experimental results.
· new_hypothesis: A string representing any new hypotheses generated based on the experiment's outcomes and evaluations.
· reason: A string explaining the rationale behind the decision regarding the original hypothesis.
· decision: A boolean indicating whether the original hypothesis is accepted (True) or rejected (False).

Code Description: The HypothesisFeedback class inherits from a Feedback base class. It initializes with five parameters that capture various aspects of the feedback process following an experiment. These include detailed observations, an evaluation of the hypothesis against these observations, any new hypotheses derived, the reason for accepting or rejecting the original hypothesis, and the final decision itself. The __bool__ method allows instances of HypothesisFeedback to be evaluated in a boolean context, returning the value of the decision attribute. The __str__ method provides a formatted string representation of all attributes, which can be useful for logging or debugging purposes.

Note: This class is typically used within an experimental framework where hypotheses are tested and feedback is generated based on the results. It plays a crucial role in iterative hypothesis testing processes, especially in scientific research and development projects.

Output Example: 
Observations: The experiment showed that under high pressure conditions, the reaction rate increased by 30%.
Hypothesis Evaluation: The initial hypothesis that pressure increases reaction rates was supported by the data.
New Hypothesis: Investigate if temperature also has a similar effect on reaction rates.
Decision: True
Reason: The experimental results align with the hypothesis and suggest further exploration of related factors.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, observations, hypothesis_evaluation, new_hypothesis, reason, decision)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the HypothesisFeedback class, capturing feedback related to an observation, hypothesis evaluation, proposed new hypothesis, reason for the decision, and the final decision itself.

parameters:
· observations: A string containing the observations made during the process or experiment.
· hypothesis_evaluation: A string summarizing the evaluation of the current hypothesis based on the observations.
· new_hypothesis: A string representing a new hypothesis that has been proposed as a result of the evaluation.
· reason: A string detailing the reasoning behind the decision to accept, reject, or modify the original hypothesis.
· decision: A boolean value indicating whether the original hypothesis was accepted (True) or rejected/modified (False).

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor for the HypothesisFeedback class. It takes five parameters and assigns them to instance variables of the same name. These variables store crucial information about the feedback process, including what was observed, how the current hypothesis was evaluated, any new hypotheses that were generated, the rationale behind the decision made, and whether the original hypothesis was accepted or not.

Note: When creating an instance of HypothesisFeedback, developers must provide all five parameters. This ensures that each piece of feedback is comprehensive and includes all necessary details for review and analysis. Beginners should ensure they understand the context in which these parameters are used to effectively utilize this class in their projects.
***
### FunctionDef __bool__(self)
**__bool__**: This method determines the truthiness of a HypothesisFeedback object based on its decision attribute.
parameters:
· None: The __bool__ method does not accept any parameters. It operates solely on the internal state of the HypothesisFeedback instance.
Code Description: The __bool__ method is a special Python method that returns a boolean value representing the truthiness of an object. In this case, it returns the value of the self.decision attribute, which should be a boolean itself (True or False). This allows instances of HypothesisFeedback to be used in contexts where a boolean value is expected, such as in if statements or while loops.
Note: The method assumes that self.decision holds a valid boolean value. If self.decision can hold other types of values, additional validation logic may be necessary to ensure the method behaves as expected.
Output Example: If an instance of HypothesisFeedback has its decision attribute set to True, calling bool(instance) will return True. Conversely, if decision is False, bool(instance) will return False.
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: This method returns a string representation of an instance of the HypothesisFeedback class, summarizing key attributes including observations, hypothesis evaluation, new hypothesis, decision, and reason.

parameters:
· None: The __str__ method does not accept any parameters. It operates on the instance variables of the class it belongs to.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __str__ method is a special method in Python used for defining a human-readable string representation of an object. In this context, it constructs a formatted string that includes several attributes of the HypothesisFeedback instance:
- Observations: This likely contains data or information gathered during an experiment or observation phase.
- Hypothesis Evaluation: This attribute holds the evaluation or assessment of a previously proposed hypothesis based on the observations.
- New Hypothesis: Following the evaluation, this field would contain a new hypothesis formulated based on the findings and evaluation.
- Decision: This indicates the decision made regarding the hypothesis, possibly whether to accept, reject, or modify it.
- Reason: Provides an explanation for the decision made.

The method uses an f-string to format these attributes into a readable multi-line string, making it easy to understand the state of the HypothesisFeedback object at any given time.

Note: Usage points.
This method is particularly useful when debugging or logging, as it provides a clear and concise summary of the feedback related to a hypothesis. It can also be used in user interfaces where a textual representation of the feedback is necessary.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
"Observations: The sample size was too small for accurate results.
Hypothesis Evaluation: Initial hypothesis that increased sunlight improves plant growth was not supported by data.
New Hypothesis: Increased sunlight may improve plant growth, but a larger sample size is needed to confirm this.
Decision: Reject initial hypothesis with current data.
Reason: Insufficient sample size led to unreliable results."
***
## ClassDef Trace
**Trace**: Represents a sequence of hypotheses, experiments, and their feedbacks within a specific scenario. It optionally includes a knowledge base to support the hypothesis generation process.

attributes:
· scen: An instance of ASpecificScen representing the specific scenario under investigation.
· knowledge_base: An optional instance of ASpecificKB that provides additional information or context for the scenario.
· hist: A list that stores tuples of Hypothesis, Experiment, and HypothesisFeedback objects, capturing the progression of hypotheses and experiments.

Code Description: The Trace class is designed to maintain a record of the hypothesis generation process within a defined scenario. It initializes with a specific scenario (scen) and an optional knowledge base (knowledge_base). The hist attribute is used to store a sequence of tuples, each containing a Hypothesis, Experiment, and HypothesisFeedback object. This allows for tracking how hypotheses are generated, experiments conducted, and feedback received throughout the process.

The method get_sota_hypothesis_and_experiment retrieves the most recent hypothesis and experiment that were deemed successful based on their corresponding feedback (i.e., where feedback.decision is True). It iterates through the hist list in reverse order to find the last such pair. If no successful hypothesis-experiment pair is found, it returns None for both.

Note: The get_sota_hypothesis_and_experiment method's return type does not currently align with its implementation as indicated by a TODO comment. This suggests that there may be an intention to modify the method's behavior or signature in future updates.

Output Example: If the hist list contains tuples representing three hypothesis-experiment-feedback cycles, and only the last one has feedback.decision set to True, then get_sota_hypothesis_and_experiment would return the Hypothesis and Experiment objects from that last tuple. If no successful cycle is found, it would return (None, None).
### FunctionDef __init__(self, scen, knowledge_base)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the Trace class, setting up essential attributes to manage hypotheses, experiments, and feedback within a specific scenario.

parameters:
· scen: An instance of ASpecificScen representing the scenario under which hypotheses are generated and tested.
· knowledge_base: An optional parameter that can be an instance of ASpecificKB. It represents a knowledge base that may be used for additional information or context during hypothesis evaluation and experimentation.

Code Description: The __init__ method is responsible for setting up the initial state of a Trace object. It takes two parameters, scen and knowledge_base. The scen parameter is mandatory and must be an instance of ASpecificScen, which defines the specific scenario in which hypotheses are being generated and tested. This could include details about experimental conditions, variables, or any other relevant context.

The hist attribute is initialized as an empty list that will store tuples containing Hypothesis, Experiment, and HypothesisFeedback objects. These tuples represent the lifecycle of a hypothesis from its generation to testing and feedback collection. The knowledge_base parameter is optional; if provided, it should be an instance of ASpecificKB and can be used to enhance the decision-making process by providing additional context or information relevant to the hypotheses being tested.

Note: This initialization method sets up the foundational structure for managing the hypothesis lifecycle within a defined scenario. Developers should ensure that the scen parameter is correctly instantiated with all necessary details about the experimental setup. The knowledge_base, if utilized, can significantly enhance the robustness and accuracy of hypothesis evaluation by incorporating external or previously gathered knowledge into the process. Beginners are encouraged to understand the role of each attribute in managing hypotheses effectively within their specific research or development context.
***
### FunctionDef get_sota_hypothesis_and_experiment(self)
**get_sota_hypothesis_and_experiment**: Accesses the last experiment result and its corresponding hypothesis where the feedback decision was positive.
parameters:
· None: This function does not take any parameters.

Code Description: The function iterates over a reversed history (self.hist) of hypotheses, experiments, and their associated feedback. It looks for the most recent entry where the feedback's decision attribute is True, indicating a successful or satisfactory outcome. Upon finding such an entry, it returns the corresponding hypothesis and experiment as a tuple. If no such entry exists in the history, it returns None for both the hypothesis and the experiment.

Note: The function signature indicates that it should return a tuple containing either Hypothesis and Experiment objects or None values. However, there is a TODO comment suggesting that the current implementation does not align with this expected behavior.

Output Example: 
Hypothesis: The new algorithm will reduce processing time by 20%.
Reason: Preliminary tests indicate that the new algorithm significantly reduces computational steps without compromising accuracy, which is expected to translate into faster processing times.
Concise Reason & Knowledge: New algorithm reduces computational steps.
Concise Observation: Tests show significant reduction in computational steps.
Concise Justification: Fewer steps mean less time spent on computation.
Concise Knowledge: Computational efficiency improves with fewer operations.

Experiment: Experiment conducted to test the new algorithm's impact on processing times. The experiment involved running a series of tests comparing the old and new algorithms under identical conditions.

In this example, if the feedback for this experiment had a decision attribute set to True, the function would return the Hypothesis and Experiment objects as shown above. If no such positive feedback entry exists in the history, it would return (None, None).
***
## ClassDef HypothesisGen
**HypothesisGen**: This abstract class serves as a blueprint for generating hypotheses based on given scenarios and traces. It is designed to handle different levels of prompt access, allowing for both specific level prompts and the most recent ones.

**attributes**:
· scen: An instance of the Scenario class that provides context or details about the scenario being analyzed.
· prompts: A class-level attribute representing a collection of prompts used in hypothesis generation.

**Code Description**: The HypothesisGen class is an abstract base class (ABC) that requires any subclass to implement the `gen` method. This method takes a Trace object as input and returns a Hypothesis object. The primary purpose of this method is to generate hypotheses based on the provided trace within the context of the scenario.

The constructor (`__init__`) initializes an instance with a specific scenario, which is stored in the `scen` attribute. This setup allows the hypothesis generation process to be tailored to the specifics of each scenario.

The `gen` method is abstract and must be defined by any subclass of HypothesisGen. It accepts a Trace object as input, which likely contains information about the sequence of events or data points relevant to the scenario. The method's implementation should generate a hypothesis that reflects an interpretation or prediction based on this trace.

**Note**: Usage points include creating subclasses of HypothesisGen and implementing the `gen` method to define specific logic for generating hypotheses in different contexts. Developers should ensure that their implementations correctly handle the Trace input and produce meaningful Hypothesis outputs relevant to the scenario provided during initialization.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, scen)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the HypothesisGen class with a given scenario.
parameters:
· scen: An object representing the scenario for which hypotheses will be generated.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor that sets up a new instance of the HypothesisGen class. It takes one parameter, scen, which is expected to be an instance of the Scenario class or a similar structure containing all necessary information about the scenario in question. This scenario object is then stored as an attribute self.scen within the newly created instance. The primary purpose of this method is to ensure that each HypothesisGen object has access to the specific scenario data it needs for generating hypotheses.

Note: Usage points include creating a new instance of HypothesisGen by passing a Scenario object to the constructor, which will allow the object to utilize the scenario details in subsequent operations such as hypothesis generation. It is essential that the scen parameter provided is correctly formatted and contains all required information for accurate hypothesis generation processes.
***
### FunctionDef gen(self, trace)
**gen**: This function generates a hypothesis based on a given trace of hypotheses, experiments, and feedbacks within a specific scenario.

parameters:
· trace: An instance of Trace that represents a sequence of hypotheses, experiments, and their feedbacks within a particular scenario. It includes information about the scenario being investigated and optionally a knowledge base to support the generation process.

Code Description: The gen function takes a Trace object as input and returns a Hypothesis object. The primary purpose of this function is to analyze the historical data contained in the trace (which includes previous hypotheses, experiments conducted, and feedback received) to generate a new hypothesis. This new hypothesis is expected to be informed by the outcomes of prior experiments and any available knowledge base.

The function's implementation details are not provided in the given code snippet, but based on its signature and the context, it likely involves examining the hist attribute of the Trace object (which contains tuples of Hypothesis, Experiment, and HypothesisFeedback) to derive insights. It may also consider the scenario description and any knowledge base associated with the trace to formulate a new hypothesis.

The generated Hypothesis object encapsulates several key components:
- A main hypothesis statement.
- Detailed reasoning for why this hypothesis is proposed.
- Concise summaries of the reasoning, observations, justifications, and relevant knowledge supporting the hypothesis.

These components are designed to provide a comprehensive yet accessible explanation of the hypothesis, facilitating clear communication and easy reference throughout its lifecycle within the system.

Note: The function currently expects a Trace object as input rather than a scenario description string. Developers should ensure that they pass an appropriate Trace instance when calling this function. Additionally, understanding the structure and contents of the Trace object is crucial for effectively utilizing the gen function to generate meaningful hypotheses.
***
## ClassDef Hypothesis2Experiment
**Hypothesis2Experiment**: This abstract class serves as a bridge between theoretical hypotheses and concrete experimental implementations. It is designed to convert a given hypothesis, along with its trace (which could represent data or context related to the hypothesis), into a specific type of experiment.

**attributes**:
· Hypothesis: Represents the theoretical idea or proposition that needs to be tested.
· Trace: Contains additional information or data relevant to the hypothesis, which might be necessary for the conversion process.

**Code Description**: The `Hypothesis2Experiment` class inherits from both `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) and `Generic[ASpecificExp]`. Being an abstract base class means that it cannot be instantiated on its own; instead, it is meant to be subclassed by other classes that provide concrete implementations. The use of generics (`Generic[ASpecificExp]`) indicates that this class can work with any specific type of experiment represented by `ASpecificExp`.

The core functionality of the class is encapsulated in the abstract method `convert`. This method takes two parameters: a `Hypothesis` object and a `Trace` object. The purpose of this method is to define how a hypothesis, along with its associated trace data, should be transformed into an experiment of type `ASpecificExp`. Since it is marked as an abstract method using the `@abstractmethod` decorator, any subclass of `Hypothesis2Experiment` must provide its own implementation of the `convert` method.

**Note**: Usage points. Developers are expected to create subclasses of `Hypothesis2Experiment`, providing a concrete implementation for the `convert` method that suits their specific experimental setup and requirements. This design pattern allows for flexibility and modularity, enabling different types of hypotheses and traces to be converted into various kinds of experiments as needed. Beginners should focus on understanding how to extend this abstract class by implementing the `convert` method in a way that aligns with their research or project goals.
### FunctionDef convert(self, hypothesis, trace)
**convert**: Connects a hypothesis to an experiment by converting the idea proposal into a specific experimental setup.
parameters:
· hypothesis: An instance of the Hypothesis class representing the scientific or logical proposition along with its detailed and concise explanations.
· trace: An instance of the Trace class that maintains a record of hypotheses, experiments, and their feedbacks within a specific scenario.

Code Description: The convert function is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical hypothesis formulation and practical experimental design. It takes two primary inputs: a Hypothesis object and a Trace object. The Hypothesis object encapsulates a detailed scientific or logical proposition along with supporting explanations, observations, justifications, and knowledge. This structured representation ensures that all critical aspects of the hypothesis are clearly defined and easily accessible.

The Trace object, on the other hand, provides context by representing a sequence of hypotheses, experiments, and their feedbacks within a specific scenario. It includes attributes such as scen (the specific scenario under investigation) and hist (a list of tuples containing Hypothesis, Experiment, and HypothesisFeedback objects). This historical record is crucial for understanding the progression of ideas and experimental outcomes.

The function's primary role is to utilize these inputs to create an ASpecificExp object. While the exact implementation details are not provided, it can be inferred that this conversion process involves translating the structured hypothesis into a concrete experimental setup that aligns with the scenario described in the Trace object. This ensures that the experiment is directly relevant and tailored to test the specific aspects of the hypothesis.

Note: The convert function is integral to the lifecycle management of hypotheses within the system, facilitating the transition from idea generation to experimental validation. Developers should ensure that both the Hypothesis and Trace objects are properly initialized with all necessary information before invoking this function. Beginners are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the structure and purpose of the Hypothesis and Trace classes to effectively utilize the convert function in their work.
***
## ClassDef HypothesisExperiment2Feedback
**HypothesisExperiment2Feedback**: This abstract class serves as a blueprint for generating feedback on hypotheses based on executed implementations of different tasks, along with comparisons to previous performances.

attributes:
· scen: An instance of the Scenario class that provides context or settings for the experiment.

Code Description: The HypothesisExperiment2Feedback class is designed to be extended by other classes. It requires an implementation of the `generate_feedback` method, which takes three parameters: `exp`, an instance of Experiment representing the executed experiment; `hypothesis`, an instance of Hypothesis that represents the hypothesis being tested; and `trace`, an instance of Trace that likely contains detailed information about the execution process. The purpose of this method is to generate feedback on the hypothesis based on the results of the executed experiment, including a comparison with previous performance data, possibly sourced from tools like MLflow in Qlib.

Note: Usage points include extending this class and implementing the `generate_feedback` method to provide specific feedback mechanisms tailored to different experimental setups or hypotheses. Developers should ensure that their implementations adhere to the expected input types and output format of HypothesisFeedback. Beginners are encouraged to understand the roles of Scenario, Experiment, Hypothesis, and Trace in the context of hypothesis testing and performance comparison before implementing custom feedback generation logic.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, scen)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the HypothesisExperiment2Feedback class with a given scenario.
parameters:
· scen: An object representing the scenario under which the hypothesis experiment is conducted.

Code Description: The __init__ method serves as the constructor for the HypothesisExperiment2Feedback class. It takes one parameter, scen, which is expected to be an instance of the Scenario class. This method assigns the provided scen object to the self.scen attribute of the class instance. Essentially, it sets up the initial state of the HypothesisExperiment2Feedback object by storing the scenario details that will be used throughout the experiment.

Note: Usage points include creating a new instance of HypothesisExperiment2Feedback by passing an appropriate Scenario object as an argument to the constructor. This setup is crucial for conducting experiments under specific conditions or settings encapsulated within the Scenario object.
***
### FunctionDef generate_feedback(self, exp, hypothesis, trace)
**generate_feedback**: This function is designed to generate feedback on a hypothesis after an experiment has been conducted. It takes three parameters: an Experiment object, a Hypothesis object, and a Trace object. The function is intended to execute the provided experiment, include its results, and compare these results with previous experiments (handled by an LLM). Currently, this method is not implemented and raises a NotImplementedError.

parameters:
· exp: An instance of the Experiment class representing the experiment that has been conducted.
· hypothesis: An instance of the Hypothesis class containing the hypothesis being tested along with its reasoning and concise summaries.
· trace: An instance of the Trace class that records the sequence of hypotheses, experiments, and their feedbacks within a specific scenario.

Code Description: The function generate_feedback is part of a larger system designed for iterative hypothesis testing. It is expected to evaluate how well a given hypothesis aligns with experimental results, provide detailed observations from the experiment, and potentially generate new hypotheses based on these findings. However, as it stands, the function does not perform any operations related to these tasks. Instead, it raises a NotImplementedError with the message "generate_feedback method is not implemented." This indicates that while the function's purpose is defined, its implementation details have yet to be developed.

Note: Developers and beginners should be aware that calling this function will result in an error until it is properly implemented. The intended functionality involves integrating machine learning models (LLM) to compare current experimental results with previous ones, possibly using tools like mlflow from Qlib for tracking experiment results. Implementing this function would require defining the logic for executing experiments, evaluating hypotheses, and generating feedback based on these evaluations.
