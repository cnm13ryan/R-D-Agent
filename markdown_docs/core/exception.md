## ClassDef CoderError
**CoderError**: This class represents exceptions specifically raised during the implementation and execution phases of code within a system. It serves as a base exception for more specific error types, such as CodeFormatError, CustomRuntimeError, and NoOutputError.

attributes:
· None: The CoderError class does not define any specific attributes beyond those inherited from Python's built-in Exception class.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The CoderError class is a custom exception designed to encapsulate errors that occur during the process of implementing and running code. This process typically begins with a FactorTask, which is then transformed into a FactorGenerator. The ultimate goal is to generate a dataframe after execution. However, any issues encountered along this path are captured by raising instances of CoderError or its subclasses.

The detailed evaluation of the results contained within the dataframe values is managed separately by an evaluator component, not directly by the CoderError class itself. This separation allows for clear delineation between error handling and result analysis, promoting a clean architecture where concerns are well-defined and isolated.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should use this exception class or its subclasses to handle specific errors that arise during code implementation and execution phases. By catching these exceptions, developers can provide meaningful feedback to users or take corrective actions as needed. For instance, if a format error is detected in the generated code, a CodeFormatError could be raised, which is a subclass of CoderError. Similarly, CustomRuntimeError would be used for issues encountered during script execution, and NoOutputError would indicate failures in generating output files. This structured approach to exception handling enhances the robustness and maintainability of the system by clearly defining how different types of errors are managed.
## ClassDef CodeFormatError
**CodeFormatError**: This class represents a specific type of exception that is raised when the generated code does not meet the expected format, leading to issues during its implementation or execution phases.

attributes:
· None: The CodeFormatError class does not define any specific attributes beyond those inherited from its parent class, CoderError, and ultimately Python's built-in Exception class.

Code Description: The CodeFormatError is a subclass of CoderError, which itself is designed to handle exceptions that occur during the process of implementing and running code. This particular exception focuses on scenarios where the format of the generated code is incorrect or does not conform to the required specifications. Such errors can arise from various sources, including syntax issues, missing components, or incorrect data types within the code.

When a CodeFormatError is raised, it indicates that there is a problem with how the code has been structured or written, preventing its successful execution. This exception allows developers to catch and handle these specific format-related issues separately from other types of errors, such as runtime errors or failures in generating output files. By doing so, developers can provide more targeted feedback to users or implement corrective measures to address the formatting problems.

Note: Usage points. Developers should use this exception class to handle cases where generated code does not meet the required format standards. Catching a CodeFormatError enables developers to identify and rectify issues related to code structure and syntax, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of their applications. This structured approach to error handling helps in maintaining clean and manageable codebases by clearly defining how different types of errors are addressed.
## ClassDef CustomRuntimeError
**CustomRuntimeError**: This class represents exceptions specifically raised when the generated code fails to execute a script. It inherits from the CoderError class, which is designed to handle errors during the implementation and execution phases of code.

attributes:
· None: The CustomRuntimeError class does not define any specific attributes beyond those inherited from its parent class, CoderError, and ultimately from Python's built-in Exception class.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The CustomRuntimeError class is a specialized exception used to indicate issues that occur during the execution phase of generated code. This typically happens after the code has been successfully implemented and transformed into an executable form, such as through a FactorGenerator process, but before it can produce the desired output, like a dataframe. The failure could be due to various reasons, including logical errors in the code, runtime environment issues, or unexpected input data.

This exception is part of a broader error handling framework that includes other subclasses of CoderError, such as CodeFormatError and NoOutputError. Each subclass is tailored to handle specific types of errors, allowing for more precise and meaningful feedback when exceptions are raised. By catching CustomRuntimeError, developers can implement recovery strategies or provide detailed error messages to users, enhancing the overall robustness and user experience of their applications.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should use this exception class to handle scenarios where generated code fails during execution. For example, if a script is supposed to process data but encounters an unexpected condition that prevents it from completing successfully, raising a CustomRuntimeError would be appropriate. This approach helps in maintaining clean and organized error handling practices, making the system easier to debug and maintain. By leveraging this structured exception hierarchy, developers can ensure that different types of errors are managed consistently across their codebase.
## ClassDef NoOutputError
**NoOutputError**: This class represents a specific type of exception that is raised when the system fails to generate an output file during the implementation and execution phases of code.

attributes:
· None: The NoOutputError class does not define any specific attributes beyond those inherited from its parent class, CoderError, which in turn inherits from Python's built-in Exception class.

Code Description: NoOutputError is a subclass of CoderError, designed to handle scenarios where the generation of an output file fails. This could occur at various stages during the process of transforming a FactorTask into a FactorGenerator and ultimately executing it to produce a dataframe. When such a failure happens, raising a NoOutputError allows the system to gracefully handle this issue by providing a clear indication that no output was produced.

NoOutputError is part of a structured exception handling framework within the system. This framework includes other subclasses of CoderError, each tailored to specific types of errors encountered during code implementation and execution. By using these specific exceptions, developers can implement more targeted error handling strategies, leading to more robust and maintainable code.

Note: Usage points. Developers should raise a NoOutputError when their code fails to generate the expected output file. Catching this exception allows for appropriate responses, such as logging the error, notifying users, or attempting corrective actions. This approach ensures that different types of errors are handled in a consistent and organized manner, enhancing the overall reliability of the system.
## ClassDef CustomRunnerError
**CustomRunnerError**: This class defines a custom exception specifically designed to be raised when errors occur during the execution of code output within an application. It inherits from Python's built-in Exception class, allowing it to be caught and handled using standard exception handling mechanisms.

**attributes**:
· No specific attributes are defined in this class beyond those inherited from the base Exception class. This includes attributes like args (a tuple containing all positional arguments passed to the constructor) and message (the error message string).

**Code Description**: The CustomRunnerError class is a simple subclass of Python's built-in Exception class, tailored for scenarios where specific errors related to code execution need to be distinguished from other types of exceptions. By defining this custom exception, developers can write more targeted error handling logic in their applications. For example, they might catch instances of CustomRunnerError specifically to handle issues that arise during the execution phase of their application's workflow.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where an application needs to execute dynamically generated code or scripts and wants to provide clear, specific feedback when such executions fail. Developers can raise this exception with a descriptive error message whenever they encounter conditions indicating a failure in the code output process. This helps in debugging and maintaining the application by clearly identifying the source of execution-related issues.
## ClassDef FactorEmptyError
**FactorEmptyError**: This class represents a custom exception designed to be raised when a factor generation process fails to produce any valid factors.

attributes:
· No specific attributes are defined for this class beyond those inherited from the base Exception class.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The FactorEmptyError class is derived from Python's built-in Exception class. It serves as a specialized exception type that can be used within applications where factor generation is a critical process. By raising this specific exception, developers can catch and handle cases where no factors are generated correctly, allowing for more precise error management and debugging.

This custom exception does not introduce any new attributes or methods; it relies on the functionality provided by its parent class, Exception. This means that instances of FactorEmptyError can be created with an optional message string, which is passed to the base class constructor and can later be retrieved using the str() function or directly accessed via the .args attribute.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should raise a FactorEmptyError when their code detects that no factors have been generated as expected. This could occur in various contexts, such as data analysis, statistical modeling, or any domain where factorization is a necessary step. By using this custom exception, developers can provide clear and specific error messages to users or other parts of the application, improving the overall robustness and user-friendliness of their software.

When catching exceptions, developers should be prepared to handle FactorEmptyError specifically if they anticipate that factor generation might fail under certain conditions. This allows for targeted responses, such as logging detailed information about the failure, notifying the user, or attempting a recovery process.
## ClassDef ModelEmptyError
**ModelEmptyError**: This class represents a custom exception designed to be raised when a model fails to generate correctly, resulting in an empty or invalid state.

attributes:
· No explicit attributes are defined for this class beyond those inherited from the base Exception class.

Code Description: The ModelEmptyError class extends Python's built-in Exception class. It is specifically crafted to handle scenarios where a model creation process does not produce a valid output, leading to an empty model. By raising this exception, developers can catch and handle such cases appropriately in their applications, providing clear feedback about the nature of the error.

Note: Usage points include situations where models are dynamically generated or loaded, and there is a need to ensure that they contain data before proceeding with further operations. Developers should implement checks after model creation or loading processes to verify the validity of the model and raise ModelEmptyError if necessary. This allows for robust error handling and improves the reliability of applications that depend on correctly formed models.
## ClassDef KaggleError
**KaggleError**: This class represents exceptions specifically raised when issues occur during interactions with the Kaggle API.

attributes:
· No specific attributes are defined within this class. It inherits from Python's built-in Exception class, which means it can accept standard parameters such as message and other optional arguments that an exception might carry.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The KaggleError class is a custom exception designed to encapsulate errors related to the Kaggle API. By inheriting from Python’s base Exception class, it leverages all the functionality of exceptions in Python, including the ability to pass error messages and other relevant information when an exception is raised. This allows developers to catch and handle errors that are specific to operations involving the Kaggle API separately from other types of exceptions, making error handling more precise and effective.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should use this class to raise exceptions in their code whenever they encounter issues directly related to interactions with the Kaggle API. For example, if a request to the Kaggle API fails due to network issues or invalid parameters, a KaggleError could be raised to indicate that the problem stems from the API interaction rather than another part of the application. This helps in maintaining clean and organized error handling practices within applications that interact with the Kaggle platform.
