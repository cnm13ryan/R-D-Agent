## ClassDef Feedback
**Feedback**: The Feedback class is designed to encapsulate user feedback data within an application. Currently, it does not include any specific attributes or methods, indicating that it may be a placeholder for future development where feedback details will be stored and processed.

attributes:
· None: As of the current implementation, there are no defined attributes in the Feedback class.

Code Description: Detailed analysis reveals that the Feedback class is an empty class definition. This means it does not contain any methods or properties at this stage. The purpose of such a class could be to serve as a base for more complex feedback handling systems where additional functionality might be added later, such as storing feedback text, user ratings, timestamps, and other relevant information.

Note: Usage points include the potential future expansion of this class to handle various types of feedback data effectively. Developers should consider adding necessary attributes and methods to make it functional according to the application's requirements. Beginners are advised to understand that while this class is currently empty, its structure can be expanded with properties and behaviors as needed for their projects.
## ClassDef Evaluator
**Evaluator**: The Evaluator class serves as an abstract base class designed to evaluate implementations against a ground truth within a specified scenario. It is intended to be subclassed, requiring developers to implement the `evaluate` method tailored to their specific evaluation criteria.

attributes:
· scen: An instance of the Scenario class representing the context or environment in which the evaluation takes place.

Code Description: The Evaluator class initializes with a single parameter, scen, which is an object of type Scenario. This scenario provides the necessary context for the evaluation process. The class includes an abstract method `evaluate`, which must be implemented by any subclass. This method is responsible for comparing a target task's implementation against a ground truth implementation within the provided scenario. The method accepts additional keyword arguments (**kwargs) to accommodate varying requirements across different evaluations.

Note: Usage points include creating subclasses of Evaluator where the `evaluate` method is defined according to specific evaluation logic, such as performance metrics, accuracy checks, or compliance assessments. Developers should ensure that their implementations adhere to the expected input types and handle any additional parameters passed through **kwargs appropriately.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, scen)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the Evaluator class with a specific scenario.
parameters:
· scen: An object representing the scenario to be evaluated.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that serves as the constructor for creating new instances of the class. In this context, it initializes an evaluator specifically tied to a given scenario. When an instance of Evaluator is created, the __init__ method takes one parameter, scen, which must be an object of type Scenario. This scenario object is then stored in the instance variable self.scen, making it accessible for other methods within the Evaluator class to use during evaluation processes.

Note: Usage points include creating an evaluator instance by passing a valid Scenario object to the constructor. This setup allows the evaluator to perform evaluations based on the details and conditions defined within the provided scenario. Developers should ensure that the scen parameter is correctly instantiated as a Scenario object before initializing an Evaluator, to avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior during evaluation processes.

### FunctionDef evaluate(self, target_task, implementation, gt_implementation)
**evaluate**: This function is designed to evaluate a given implementation against a ground truth implementation for a specific task. It serves as an abstract method, meaning it must be implemented by any subclass that inherits from Evaluator.

**parameters**:
· target_task: An instance of Task representing the task being evaluated.
· implementation: A Workspace object containing the implementation to be evaluated.
· gt_implementation: A Workspace object containing the ground truth implementation against which the evaluation will be performed.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to the function, providing flexibility for future enhancements or additional parameters.

**Code Description**: The evaluate method is currently defined with a NotImplementedError, indicating that it has not yet been implemented in this class. This suggests that Evaluator serves as an abstract base class, and subclasses are expected to provide their own implementation of the evaluate method tailored to specific evaluation criteria or methodologies. The method takes three primary parameters: target_task, which specifies the task context; implementation, which is the candidate solution being evaluated; and gt_implementation, which represents the standard or correct solution against which the candidate will be compared. The use of **kwargs allows for additional flexibility in passing parameters that might be necessary for specific evaluation processes.

**Note**: Usage points include ensuring that any subclass of Evaluator implements this method to provide meaningful evaluation logic. Developers should refer to the documentation of subclasses for specific details on how the evaluate function is implemented and what additional parameters might be required or supported. Beginners are advised to understand the context in which this method will be used, particularly the nature of Task and Workspace objects, before attempting to implement their own evaluation logic.
