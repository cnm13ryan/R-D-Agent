## ClassDef Prompts
**Prompts**: A class designed to load and manage a collection of prompts from a YAML file. It inherits from both `SingletonBaseClass` and `dict[str, str]`, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application and that it behaves like a dictionary with string keys and values.

attributes:
· file_path: A Path object representing the location of the YAML file containing the prompts.

Code Description: The Prompts class initializes by accepting a file path to a YAML file. It opens this file using UTF-8 encoding and loads its contents into a Python dictionary using `yaml.safe_load()`. If the file is empty or cannot be loaded, it raises a ValueError with an appropriate error message. After successfully loading the prompts, it iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary and assigns them to itself, making it behave like a standard dictionary where keys are prompt identifiers and values are the corresponding prompt texts.

Note: Usage points include initializing this class with the path to a YAML file containing prompts, ensuring that the file is correctly formatted in YAML. Once initialized, instances of Prompts can be used throughout the application to access specific prompts by their key, leveraging its dictionary-like behavior. Due to its Singleton nature, any modifications to an instance of Prompts will reflect across all references to it within the application.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, file_path)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the Prompts class by loading prompts from a specified YAML file.

parameters:
· file_path: A Path object representing the location of the YAML file containing the prompts.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __init__ method is the constructor for the Prompts class. It takes one parameter, `file_path`, which should be an instance of Python's `Path` from the pathlib module, pointing to a YAML file that contains prompt definitions. The method begins by calling the superclass's initializer with `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization logic in the parent class is executed.

Next, it opens the specified file using the UTF-8 encoding and reads its contents into a Python dictionary named `prompt_yaml_dict` using `yaml.safe_load(file)`. If the YAML file is empty or improperly formatted such that `prompt_yaml_dict` becomes None, an error message is constructed indicating the failure to load prompts from the given file path. This error message is then used to raise a ValueError, halting further execution and signaling the issue.

If the YAML file is successfully loaded into `prompt_yaml_dict`, the method iterates over each key-value pair in this dictionary. For each pair, it assigns the value to an attribute of the current instance (`self`) using the key as the attribute name. This effectively populates the Prompts object with the data from the YAML file, making each prompt accessible via its corresponding key.

Note: Usage points.
When creating an instance of the Prompts class, ensure that the `file_path` parameter is a valid Path to a YAML file containing properly formatted prompts. The structure of this YAML file should be such that it can be loaded into a dictionary where keys are identifiers for each prompt and values are the corresponding prompt texts or configurations. This setup allows for easy access and manipulation of prompts within an application, facilitating dynamic interactions based on user input or other conditions.
