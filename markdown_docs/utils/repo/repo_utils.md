Doc is waiting to be generated...
### FunctionDef __init__(self, repo_path)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the RepoAnalyzer class, setting up the repository path and an empty dictionary to store summaries.

parameters:
· repo_path: A string representing the file system path to the repository that will be analyzed.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __init__ method is the constructor for the RepoAnalyzer class. It takes a single parameter, `repo_path`, which should be a string indicating the location of the repository on the filesystem. Inside the method, this string is converted into a Path object using Python's `Path` class from the `pathlib` module. This conversion allows for more convenient and platform-independent path manipulations later in the code.

Additionally, an empty dictionary named `summaries` is initialized as an instance variable. This dictionary will be used to store various summaries or analyses of the repository throughout the lifecycle of a RepoAnalyzer object. The keys and values stored in this dictionary would depend on the methods defined within the RepoAnalyzer class that perform specific analyses and populate this structure.

Note: Usage points.
When creating an instance of the RepoAnalyzer class, developers must provide a valid path to a repository as a string argument. This path can be absolute or relative, but it should point to a directory containing the repository files. For example:

```python
repo_analyzer = RepoAnalyzer('/path/to/my/repository')
```

This line of code initializes a new RepoAnalyzer object with the specified repository path. The `summaries` dictionary is ready for use by other methods in the class, which would populate it with analysis results as needed.

### FunctionDef summarize_repo(self, verbose_level, doc_str_level, sign_level)
**summarize_repo**: Generate a natural language summary of the entire repository workspace.

parameters:
· verbose_level: Level of verbosity for the summary (0-2). A higher value includes more detailed information.
· doc_str_level: Level of detail for docstrings (0-2). A non-zero value includes docstrings in the summary.
· sign_level: Level of detail for function signatures (0-2). A non-zero value includes additional information about functions and methods.

Code Description: The `summarize_repo` method provides a comprehensive overview of a repository by summarizing all Python files within it. It begins by generating a tree-like structure of the directory hierarchy using the `_generate_tree_structure` method, which helps visualize the organization of the repository. 

The method then iterates through each file in the repository that ends with the `.py` extension. For each Python file, it calculates its relative path to the root of the repository and generates a detailed summary using the `_summarize_file` method. This summary includes information about classes and functions defined within the file, based on the provided verbosity levels for detail, docstrings, and function signatures.

The summaries of all files are collected into a single string that also includes the total number of Python files in the repository. The final output is a structured summary that begins with the workspace name, followed by the directory structure, the count of Python files, and detailed summaries of each file.

Note: This function is useful for quickly understanding the contents and organization of a repository, especially when dealing with large codebases. It can be used to generate reports or documentation about the repository's structure and components.

Output Example:

### FunctionDef _generate_tree_structure(self)
**_generate_tree_structure**: This function generates a string representation of a tree-like structure of the repository's directory hierarchy, focusing on Python files.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on an instance variable `self.repo_path` which should be set to the path of the repository being analyzed.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `_generate_tree_structure` method constructs a visual representation of the directory structure within a given repository. It uses Python's built-in `os.walk()` function to traverse the directory tree rooted at `self.repo_path`. For each directory encountered, it calculates its depth relative to the root of the repository by counting the number of path separators (`os.sep`). This level is used to determine the indentation for that directory in the output string. Directories are represented with a trailing slash `/` to distinguish them from files.

The method appends each directory and Python file (files ending with `.py`) to a list called `tree`, formatting them with appropriate indentation to reflect their position within the hierarchy. The final tree structure is constructed by joining all elements of the `tree` list into a single string, separated by newline characters (`\n`). This results in a neatly formatted directory tree that can be easily read and understood.

Note: Usage points.
This function is typically used internally within classes or modules designed to analyze repository structures. It provides a clear visual representation of the repository's layout, which can be useful for generating summaries, documentation, or reports about the repository's contents.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.

### FunctionDef _summarize_file(self, file_path, verbose_level, doc_str_level, sign_level)
**_summarize_file**: This function generates a summary of a specified Python file by analyzing its abstract syntax tree (AST). It provides details about the classes and functions defined within the file, including counts, names, and additional information based on verbosity levels.

parameters:
· file_path: A Path object representing the path to the Python file to be summarized.
· verbose_level: An integer indicating the level of detail in the summary. Higher values result in more detailed summaries.
· doc_str_level: An integer determining whether to include docstrings in the summary. A value greater than 0 includes them.
· sign_level: An integer deciding whether to include additional information about functions and methods, such as their signatures. This parameter is passed to the `_summarize_function` method.

Code Description: The function starts by reading the content of the file specified by `file_path`. It then parses this content into an AST using Python's `ast.parse()` function. A summary string is initialized with the relative path of the file within the repository.

The function identifies all class and function definitions in the AST. If any classes are found, it appends a count to the summary. Similarly, if functions are present, it also includes their count. For each identified class or function, the function calls `_summarize_class` or `_summarize_function`, respectively, passing along the verbosity levels and docstring inclusion parameters. These helper functions generate detailed summaries for classes and functions, which are then appended to the overall summary string.

Note: This function is typically used as part of a larger summarization process, such as when generating a summary for an entire repository. It leverages other methods like `_summarize_class` and `_summarize_function` to provide comprehensive summaries of individual components within the file.

Output Example: Given a Python file with the following content:
```python
class Calculator:
    """A simple calculator class."""

    def add(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        """Add two integers."""
        return a + b

def multiply(x: float, y: float) -> float:
    """Multiply two floats."""
    return x * y
```
Calling `_summarize_file` with `sign_level=1`, `doc_str_level=1`, and `verbose_level=2` would produce the following summary:
```
File: utils/calculator.py
----------------------------------------
This file contains 1 class.
This file contains 1 top-level function.

Class: Calculator
  Description: A simple calculator class.
  This class has 1 method.
  Function: add
    Signature: add(self, a: int, b: int) -> int
    Purpose: Add two integers.

Function: multiply
  Signature: multiply(x: float, y: float) -> float
  Purpose: Multiply two floats.
```

### FunctionDef _summarize_class(self, node, verbose_level, doc_str_level, sign_level)
**_summarize_class**: This function generates a summary of a given Python class node from an abstract syntax tree (AST). It includes details such as the class name, description based on its docstring, and information about the methods it contains. The level of detail is controlled by parameters that specify verbosity, inclusion of docstrings, and other aspects.

**parameters**:
· node: An AST node representing a class definition.
· verbose_level: An integer indicating the level of detail in the summary. Higher values result in more detailed summaries.
· doc_str_level: An integer determining whether to include the class's docstring in the summary. A value greater than 0 includes it.
· sign_level: An integer deciding whether to include additional information about methods in the summary. This parameter is passed to the `_summarize_function` method, which handles function summaries.

**Code Description**: The function begins by initializing a summary string with the class name. If `doc_str_level` is greater than 0 and the class has a docstring, it extracts the first sentence of the docstring (up to the first period) to provide a brief description. It then identifies all method definitions within the class body.

If there are methods in the class, the function appends information about their count to the summary string. If `verbose_level` is greater than 1, it iterates over each method and calls `_summarize_function` to generate detailed summaries for each method, appending these to the overall class summary. The final summary string, which includes all relevant information based on the provided parameters, is then returned.

**Note**: This function is typically used in conjunction with other summarization functions like `_summarize_file`, which handles files by calling `_summarize_class` for each class definition encountered and `_summarize_function` for top-level functions.

**Output Example**: Given a class defined as follows:
```python
class ExampleClass:
    """This is an example class that demonstrates summarization."""

    def method_one(self, param1: int) -> None:
        """Method one does something with the parameter."""
        pass

    def method_two(self):
        """Method two performs another task."""
        pass
```
Calling `_summarize_class` with `sign_level=1`, `doc_str_level=1`, and `verbose_level=2` would produce the following summary:
```
Class: ExampleClass
  Description: This is an example class that demonstrates summarization.
  This class has 2 methods.
  Function: method_one
    Signature: method_one(self, param1: int) -> None
    Purpose: Method one does something with the parameter.
  Function: method_two
    Signature: method_two(self)
    Purpose: Method two performs another task.
```

### FunctionDef _summarize_function(self, node, verbose_level, doc_str_level, sign_level, indent)
**_summarize_function**: This function generates a summary of a given Python function node from an abstract syntax tree (AST). It includes details such as the function name, signature, and purpose based on the provided verbosity levels.

parameters:
· node: An AST node representing a function definition.
· verbose_level: An integer indicating the level of detail in the summary. Higher values result in more detailed summaries.
· doc_str_level: An integer determining whether to include the function's docstring in the summary. A value greater than 0 includes it.
· sign_level: An integer deciding whether to include the function signature in the summary. A value greater than 0 includes it.
· indent: A string used for indentation in the output summary, defaulting to an empty string.

Code Description: The function starts by initializing a summary string with the function name. If `sign_level` is greater than 0, it constructs the function signature by iterating over the arguments and their annotations, handling variable-length argument lists (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`). It then checks if there is a return type specified in the AST node and appends it to the signature.

Next, if `doc_str_level` is greater than 0 and the function has a docstring, it extracts the first sentence of the docstring (up to the first period) to provide a brief purpose description. The summary string is then returned, containing all relevant information based on the provided parameters.

Note: This function is typically used in conjunction with other summarization functions like `_summarize_file` and `_summarize_class`, which handle files and classes respectively, by calling `_summarize_function` for each function definition encountered.

Output Example: Given a function defined as follows:
```python
def example_function(param1: int, param2: str = "default") -> bool:
    """This is an example function that does something."""
    return True
```
Calling `_summarize_function` with `sign_level=1`, `doc_str_level=1`, and `verbose_level=1` would produce the following summary:
```
Function: example_function
  Signature: example_function(param1: int, param2: str = "default") -> bool
  Purpose: This is an example function that does something.
```
***
### FunctionDef highlight(self, file_names)
**highlight**: This function extracts content from specified file(s) within a repository and returns a dictionary mapping each file name to its content.

parameters:
· file_names: A single file name (string) or a list of file names (List[str]) for which the content needs to be extracted.

Code Description: The highlight function is designed to read one or more files from a specified repository path. It accepts either a single filename as a string or multiple filenames in a list format. For each file, it constructs the full file path by combining the repository path with the provided filename. If the file exists and is indeed a file (not a directory), it reads the content of the file and stores it in a dictionary under the corresponding filename key. If the file does not exist or is not accessible, it records an error message indicating that the file was not found.

Note: This function assumes that the repository path (`self.repo_path`) has been set up correctly before calling `highlight`. It is essential to ensure that the paths provided in `file_names` are relative to this repository path. The function handles both single and multiple files gracefully, making it versatile for different use cases.

Output Example: 
{
    'README.md': '# Sample Repository\nThis is a sample repository for demonstration purposes.',
    'setup.py': "from setuptools import setup, find_packages...\n",
    'nonexistent.txt': 'File not found: nonexistent.txt'
}
