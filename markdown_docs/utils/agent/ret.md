## ClassDef AgentOut
**AgentOut**: This is an abstract class designed to define a standard interface for handling outputs from agents. It includes two methods: `get_spec` and `extract_output`. The `get_spec` method is intended to return a specification string that describes how the agent should format its output, while `extract_output` processes the response from the agent to extract meaningful data.

**attributes**:
· **context**: A variable number of keyword arguments that can be passed to the `get_spec` method. These parameters are meant to provide additional information or configuration options for generating the specification string.
· **resp**: A string representing the raw output received from an agent, which is processed by the `extract_output` method.

**Code Description**: The `AgentOut` class serves as a blueprint for creating specific types of output handlers tailored to different agents. It uses abstract methods to enforce that any subclass must implement both `get_spec` and `extract_output`. The `get_spec` method, marked with `@abstractclassmethod`, is expected to return a string that specifies the format or structure in which the agent should provide its output. This could include instructions on how to wrap code blocks, use specific delimiters, or follow certain formatting guidelines.

The `extract_output` method, also an abstract class method, takes a single argument `resp`, which is the raw response from the agent. Its purpose is to parse this response and extract the relevant information or data that the system needs. The implementation of this method will vary depending on how the agent formats its output, as defined by the specification returned by `get_spec`.

**Note**: Usage points include subclassing `AgentOut` to create specific handlers for different types of agents. Each subclass should implement the `get_spec` and `extract_output` methods according to the requirements of the corresponding agent. For example, a handler for an agent that outputs Python code might use regular expressions to extract the code block from the response, as shown in the `PythonAgentOut` class. Developers are expected to understand the output format of their agents and tailor these methods accordingly to ensure proper data extraction and processing.
### FunctionDef get_spec(cls)
**get_spec**: This function is intended to retrieve a specification string based on the provided context. However, it currently raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that this method needs to be implemented by subclasses or specific use cases.

parameters:
· cls: Represents the class itself rather than an instance of the class. It is used in class methods.
· **context: Any: This parameter allows for any number of keyword arguments to be passed into the function. These are intended to provide additional context necessary for generating the specification string.

Code Description: The function `get_spec` is defined as a method that should return a string representing some kind of specification or configuration based on the given context. At present, it does not perform any operations and instead raises an exception. This suggests that the actual implementation details are to be provided by subclasses or specific implementations of this class. The use of `**context` allows for flexibility in what information can be passed to the function, making it adaptable to various scenarios where different types of context might be needed.

Note: Usage points include understanding that this method is not yet functional and requires implementation. Developers should override this method in subclasses to provide a meaningful specification string based on their specific requirements. Beginners should note that encountering a NotImplementedError typically means that further development or customization is necessary before the function can be used effectively.

### FunctionDef extract_output(cls, resp)
**extract_output**: This function is intended to process a string response (`resp`) and extract meaningful output from it. However, based on the current implementation, it simply raises an exception using the provided string as the exception message.

parameters:
· resp: A string representing the response that needs to be processed or extracted for useful information.

Code Description: The function `extract_output` is defined with a class method signature (`cls`), indicating it should be called on a class rather than an instance of a class. It takes one parameter, `resp`, which is expected to be a string. Instead of performing any extraction logic, the function raises an exception using the `raise` statement with `resp` as its argument. This behavior suggests that the function is incomplete or incorrectly implemented for its intended purpose.

Note: Usage points. Given the current implementation, this function should not be used as it will always result in an exception being raised. Developers are advised to either complete the function with appropriate logic to extract output from the response string or remove it if it serves no purpose. Beginners should be cautious when encountering functions that raise exceptions without clear context and ensure they understand the intended functionality before attempting to use them.

## ClassDef PythonAgentOut
**PythonAgentOut**: This class extends `AgentOut` to handle outputs specifically formatted as Python code blocks within a response string. It provides implementations for the abstract methods `get_spec` and `extract_output`, tailored to extract Python code from responses wrapped in triple backticks followed by "python".

attributes:
· **context**: Although not directly used in this class, it is inherited from `AgentOut`. This parameter can be utilized in subclasses if additional configuration or context is needed for generating the specification string.
· **resp**: A string representing the raw output received from an agent. This response is processed by the `extract_output` method to extract Python code.

Code Description: The `PythonAgentOut` class is designed to work with responses that contain Python code blocks formatted in a specific way, using triple backticks (```python ... ```) as delimiters. The `get_spec` method returns a template string indicating how such outputs should be structured, which can be useful for agents generating these types of responses.

The `extract_output` method uses a regular expression to search within the response string for content enclosed between ```python and ```. If a match is found, it extracts the Python code contained within this block. This method is crucial for parsing agent outputs that include embedded code snippets, ensuring that only the relevant Python code is extracted.

Note: Developers can use `PythonAgentOut` as a reference or base class when creating output handlers for agents that produce Python code. The regular expression used in `extract_output` assumes that the Python code block is properly formatted with triple backticks and the language identifier "python". Adjustments may be necessary if the agent uses different delimiters or formatting conventions.

Output Example: Given a response string like "Here is some Python code:\n```python\ndef hello_world():\n    print('Hello, world!')\n```\nEnd of code.", the `extract_output` method would return:
def hello_world():
    print('Hello, world!')
### FunctionDef get_spec(cls)
**get_spec**: This function retrieves a specification related to PythonAgentOut by accessing a template string and processing it.

parameters:
· No parameters: The function does not accept any input parameters.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function `get_spec` is defined as a class method, indicated by the `cls` parameter, which implies that it operates on the class itself rather than an instance of the class. Inside the function, there is a call to `T(".tpl:PythonAgentOut").r()`. Here, `T` appears to be a callable object or a function that takes a string argument in the format ".tpl:PythonAgentOut". This suggests that `T` might be responsible for handling template strings or identifiers. The `.r()` method is then called on the result of `T(".tpl:PythonAgentOut")`, which likely stands for "retrieve" or "resolve", indicating that it processes or fetches data based on the template string provided.

Note: Usage points.
This function can be used within a class to obtain a specification or configuration related to PythonAgentOut. It is particularly useful when dealing with systems where specifications are stored in templates and need to be accessed programmatically. Developers should ensure that `T` and its `.r()` method are properly defined elsewhere in the codebase for this function to work as intended.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming that the template ".tpl:PythonAgentOut" contains configuration details for PythonAgentOut, the output might look something like this:
```
{
    "agent_name": "PythonAgentOut",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "supported_languages": ["Python"],
    "output_formats": ["json", "xml"]
}
```
This example illustrates a JSON object that could be returned, containing metadata about the PythonAgentOut. However, the actual output will depend on what is defined in the ".tpl:PythonAgentOut" template.

### FunctionDef extract_output(cls, resp)
**extract_output**: This function is designed to extract Python code embedded within a string response, typically formatted as Markdown text. It searches for content enclosed between triple backticks followed by 'python' (case-insensitive) and returns the Python code found within.

**parameters**:
· resp: A string containing the response from which Python code needs to be extracted. This string is expected to include Markdown formatting with Python code blocks.

**Code Description**: The function utilizes regular expressions to search for a pattern that matches triple backticks followed by 'python' (case-insensitive) and then captures everything until the next set of triple backticks. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot (`.`) in the regular expression to match newline characters as well, ensuring multi-line Python code can be captured correctly. If a match is found, the function extracts the content within the matched pattern (the Python code) and returns it. If no such pattern is found, the function implicitly returns `None`.

**Note**: The function assumes that the input string contains at least one properly formatted Markdown code block with Python code. It does not handle cases where multiple Python code blocks are present; only the first match will be returned.

**Output Example**: Given a response string like "Here is some text and then a code block:\n```python\nprint('Hello, world!')\n```", the function would return "print('Hello, world!')" without the surrounding triple backticks.
